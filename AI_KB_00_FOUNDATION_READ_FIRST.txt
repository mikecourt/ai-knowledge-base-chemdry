SECTION 1: CORE BRAND STANDARDS
================================

FOUNDATION PRINCIPLE: HONESTY IS EVERYTHING
--------------------------------------------

"Honesty is Everything" is the cornerstone of all Chem-Dry customer interactions.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• Never overpromise on results—set realistic expectations
• Always acknowledge limitations upfront
• Be transparent about what can and cannot be achieved
• It's better to surprise customers with better-than-expected results than disappoint with overpromises
• Put customer's best interests first, even if it means no sale
• Build trust through transparency
• Deliver on promises consistently

WHY IT MATTERS:
Customers value and reward honesty. Honest communication leads to:
- Higher trust and credibility
- Better customer satisfaction
- More referrals and positive reviews
- Long-term customer relationships
- Lower service complaints and disputes

**REMEMBER:** Honesty builds trust, and trust builds long-term customer relationships and business success.

---

CRITICAL BRAND USAGE RULES
---------------------------

**1. NON-POSSESSIVE USAGE OF "CHEM-DRY"**

When describing Chem-Dry processes, products, or services, ALWAYS use non-possessive form:

✓ CORRECT: "The Chem-Dry Hot Carbonating Extraction process"
✓ CORRECT: "Carpet cleaning from Chem-Dry"
✓ CORRECT: "The Chem-Dry cleaning solution"
✓ CORRECT: "Chem-Dry uses..."

✗ INCORRECT: "Chem-Dry's Hot Carbonating Extraction process" (never use possessive)
✗ INCORRECT: "Chem-Dry's process" (use "The Chem-Dry process")

**WHY:** Chem-Dry is a brand name and trademark. The non-possessive form maintains proper brand usage and legal protection.

---

**2. WATER USAGE CLAIMS - ALWAYS USE MODIFIERS**

When discussing water usage, NEVER make absolute claims. Always use qualifiers:

✓ CORRECT: "uses approximately 80% less water than steam cleaning"
✓ CORRECT: "uses significantly less water than traditional methods"
✓ CORRECT: "Chem-Dry's process requires far less water"

✗ INCORRECT: "uses 80% less water" (too absolute without qualifier)
✗ INCORRECT: "uses no water" (factually false)
✗ INCORRECT: "completely waterless" (false)

**WHY:** The 80% figure is an approximation based on testing. "Approximately" provides legal protection and honest representation.

---

**3. RESIDUE CLAIMS - USE QUALIFYING LANGUAGE**

When describing residue, be specific about WHAT kind of residue:

✓ CORRECT: "leaves no dirt-attracting residue"
✓ CORRECT: "leaves no soapy residue behind"
✓ CORRECT: "doesn't use soaps or detergents that attract dirt"

✗ INCORRECT: "leaves no residue" (technically false—water is residue)
✗ INCORRECT: "completely residue-free" (too absolute)

**WHY:** Chem-Dry uses carbonation and water, which technically are residues. The key differentiation is "no dirt-attracting residue" (soaps/detergents).

---

**4. GUARANTEE AND RESULTS CLAIMS**

Always be specific about what is and isn't guaranteed:

✓ CORRECT: "We guarantee you'll be thrilled with the results, or we'll return to re-clean at no charge"
✓ CORRECT: "Our HCE process is effective at removing most common household soils"
✓ CORRECT: "Most customers see significant improvement, though results vary by condition"

✗ INCORRECT: "We guarantee complete stain removal" (can't guarantee this)
✗ INCORRECT: "Your carpets will look brand new" (overpromise)
✗ INCORRECT: "100% satisfaction guaranteed on all stains" (too absolute)

**WHY:** Honest expectation-setting prevents customer disappointment and disputes.

---

BRAND VOICE & TONE
------------------

**PROFESSIONAL YET APPROACHABLE:**
- Use conversational language, not overly formal or technical jargon
- Be friendly and helpful, not salesy or pushy
- Show expertise through knowledge, not by talking down to customer
- Use "we" and "you" to create partnership feeling

**EDUCATIONAL:**
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Help customers understand the science or process
- Position as expert guide, not just service provider
- Build value through education

**SOLUTION-FOCUSED:**
- Frame conversations around solving customer's problem
- Ask discovery questions to understand situation
- Present Chem-Dry as the solution, not just a transaction
- Focus on outcomes and benefits, not just features

**TRANSPARENT:**
- Be upfront about pricing, limitations, and realistic expectations
- Acknowledge when you don't know something (and get answers)
- Never hide information or surprise customers with fees
- Build trust through openness

**CUSTOMER-FIRST:**
- Put customer needs above sales goals
- Recommend what's best for them, even if it's a smaller sale
- Respect their budget, timeline, and priorities
- Build relationships, not just transactions

---

PROHIBITED CLAIMS & LANGUAGE
-----------------------------

NEVER say or imply:

✗ "We're the cheapest" or "Lowest prices guaranteed"
   → Focus on value, not price competition

✗ "We're the best" without context
   → Instead: "Rated #1 in customer satisfaction" (if factual)

✗ Absolute guarantees about specific stain removal
   → Instead: "We're confident we can improve/remove most common stains"

✗ Claims about health benefits without scientific backing
   → Be careful with allergy, asthma, bacteria claims—cite sources if used

✗ Negative statements about competitors by name
   → Never name competitors; compare process/approach generically

✗ False urgency ("Book today or prices go up!")
   → Create natural urgency through education, not manipulation

✗ "You need this service" (pressure language)
   → Instead: "This service would be beneficial because..."

✗ "Everyone else is doing it" (bandwagon)
   → Instead: "Many customers find this valuable because..."

HOW TO PRESENT FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS
--------------------------------------

**SCRIPT 1: When Customer Expresses Budget Concerns**

CUSTOMER: "I'm not sure I can afford that right now."

REPRESENTATIVE: "I completely understand—this is an investment. We work with [financing partner, typically GreenSky] to offer flexible payment options. For a $[amount] service, you could spread payments over 6-12 months. Subject to credit approval, you might qualify for promotional terms like same-as-cash if paid within the period. Would you like me to explain how that works?"

**SCRIPT 2: Proactive Presentation After Quote**

REPRESENTATIVE: "The investment for your [service] is $[amount]. If you'd prefer to spread that cost over time rather than pay all at once, we offer financing through [partner name]. The application is quick and easy, and you'll typically know if you're approved within minutes. Many customers find this makes professional service more accessible without straining their budget. Would you like to explore financing options?"

**SCRIPT 3: Monthly Payment Framing**

REPRESENTATIVE: "Let's put this in monthly terms. If approved for 12-month financing on this $[amount] service, you'd be looking at approximately $[amount/12] per month. That's less than [relatable monthly expense like streaming services, coffee, etc.], and it protects your [carpet/granite/home] investment for years. Would you like to apply?"

---

FINANCING APPLICATION PROCESS
------------------------------

**STEP 1: Customer Applies**
- Online application via franchise-provided link
- Takes 5-10 minutes to complete
- Requires basic information: name, address, DOB, SSN, income

**STEP 2: Credit Decision**
- Approval typically within minutes
- Customer receives credit limit and terms
- If approved, proceeds to Step 3
- If denied, customer can pay via other methods

**STEP 3: Service Completion**
- Service performed as scheduled
- Customer signs financing agreement at completion
- Financing amount charged to approved credit line
- First payment typically due 30 days later

---

FINANCING QUALIFICATION SCRIPT
-------------------------------

CUSTOMER: "Tell me more about financing."

REPRESENTATIVE: "Absolutely. We partner with [financing company name, e.g., GreenSky] to offer flexible payment plans. Here's how it works:

1. You complete a quick online application—takes about 5-10 minutes
2. You'll get a credit decision within minutes
3. If approved, you choose a payment plan that fits your budget
4. We complete your service as scheduled
5. Your first payment typically isn't due for 30 days

For services over $1,000, many customers qualify for promotional periods—like 12 months same-as-cash, meaning no interest if you pay it off within 12 months. There's no penalty for early payoff, so if you want to pay it off sooner, you can.

The best part: applying doesn't affect your credit score until you actually use the financing. Would you like me to send you the application link?"

---

ADDRESSING FINANCING CONCERNS
------------------------------

**CONCERN: "I don't want to go into debt for cleaning services."**

RESPONSE: "That's a very responsible perspective. Think of financing less as 'debt' and more as budgeting the cost over time. Instead of one large payment that might strain your budget, you're making smaller monthly payments that fit more comfortably into your cash flow. Plus, many of our financing plans have promotional periods with low or no interest if paid within the timeframe. It's a tool that makes professional service accessible without financial stress, not a long-term debt obligation."

---

**CONCERN: "What if I'm not approved?"**

RESPONSE: "That's a fair question. Financing decisions are based on credit history, and not everyone is approved. However, even if financing doesn't work out, we can discuss other alternatives. Some customers choose to schedule service a bit further out and set aside money each month. The important thing is finding an approach that works for your budget while getting your [carpet/home/etc.] the care it needs. If financing is important to you, there's no harm in applying—it won't affect your credit score unless you're approved and actually use it."

---

**CONCERN: "Are there hidden fees or interest?"**

RESPONSE: "Great question—transparency is important. Here's exactly how it works: If you're approved for a promotional period like 12 months same-as-cash and you pay off the balance within that 12 months, you pay NO interest. Zero. If you don't pay it off within the promotional period, interest does apply retroactively from the purchase date at the standard rate (typically 17-26% depending on credit approval). There are no application fees, no prepayment penalties, and no hidden charges. The financing company will provide you with full terms before you accept the offer."

---

VALUE JUSTIFICATION WITH FINANCING
-----------------------------------

When discussing financing, always reinforce the value:

**SCRIPT:**
"Let's put this in perspective. For approximately $[monthly payment] per month over 12 months, you're protecting a [carpet investment worth $X / home value / etc.] that would cost $[replacement cost] to replace. That's less than most people spend monthly on [relatable expense], and it's protecting your investment for years while [improving air quality / preventing damage / maintaining home value / etc.]. When you look at it that way, does the monthly investment seem more reasonable?"

---

SECTION 3: COMMON QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS
==========================================

These qualification questions apply across all Chem-Dry services. Use these in combination with service-specific technical questions to fully qualify leads and schedule appropriate service.

---

Q2: DECISION-MAKER CONFIRMATION
--------------------------------

**QUESTION:** "Are you the person who makes decisions about home services, or is there anyone else who needs to be involved in this decision?"

- If landlord approval needed: "I understand. Would you like us to provide a quote you can submit to your landlord, or would it be helpful for us to reach out to them directly?"

---

Q3: BUDGET AWARENESS
--------------------

**FOLLOW-UP EXAMPLES:**
- If budget-constrained: "I appreciate you sharing your budget. Let me see what we can do within $[amount]. We also offer financing that might allow you to get the full service you need while staying within comfortable monthly payments. Would you like to explore both options?"

- **RENTAL PROPERTY - TENANT:** "I rent this place"
  → Action: Different qualification (may need landlord approval), different value proposition

**FOLLOW-UP EXAMPLES:**
- If selling: "Smart move to invest in professional cleaning before listing. Buyers form impressions in the first 10 seconds, and fresh, clean [carpets/surfaces] make a huge difference. Real estate agents consistently tell us this is one of the highest-ROI improvements sellers can make. When are you planning to list?"

- If primary residence: "That's great that you're investing in your home. Professional [service] not only makes your home look and feel better day-to-day, but it also protects your investment for years to come. How long have you been in the home?"

- If rental property: "Rental properties have unique needs. Professional cleaning helps maintain property value, keeps tenants happy, and minimizes turnover costs. Are you between tenants right now, or is this maintenance while someone's living there?"

---

Q5: PREVIOUS CHEM-DRY EXPERIENCE

- If first-time: "Welcome! Let me take a moment to explain what makes Chem-Dry different from traditional steam cleaning. Our Hot Carbonating Extraction process uses approximately 80% less water, so your [carpets/surfaces] dry in 1-2 hours instead of 1-2 days. We also don't use soaps or detergents that attract dirt back, so your cleaning lasts longer. Does that sound like what you're looking for?"

- If past negative experience: "I'm sorry to hear your previous experience didn't meet expectations. That's not the standard we hold ourselves to. Let me connect you with [manager/specialist] who can understand what happened and ensure your next experience is excellent. Would that be okay?"

**8. QUESTIONS BEYOND AI KNOWLEDGE BASE**

Escalate when customer asks:
- Highly technical questions not covered in knowledge base
- Specific questions about unusual materials, surfaces, or situations
- Questions about local regulations, building codes, or compliance
- Requests for references or past work examples in specific unusual situations
- Questions requiring judgment calls or professional expertise

EXAMPLE ESCALATION SCRIPT:
"That's a great technical question that deserves a detailed expert answer. Let me connect you with one of our [senior technicians/specialists] who has extensive knowledge and can provide the specific technical information you need. They'll give you an accurate, thorough answer."

---

**9. RENTAL PROPERTY OR LANDLORD/TENANT SITUATIONS**

Escalate when:
- Tenant wants service but needs landlord approval
- Landlord wants service but needs tenant cooperation
- Property management company with multi-unit needs
- Disputes about who's responsible for payment
- Complex approval processes or documentation requirements

EXAMPLE ESCALATION SCRIPT:
"Rental property situations can involve complex approval and coordination needs. Let me connect you with our [commercial services team/property services specialist] who regularly works with landlords and property managers. They can guide you through the approval process and ensure everyone's on the same page."

---

**10. MULTIPLE FAILED QUALIFICATION ATTEMPTS**

Escalate when:
- AI has asked clarifying questions multiple times without clear answers
- Customer seems confused by qualification process or AI interaction
- Conversation is going in circles without making progress
- Customer expresses frustration with AI or automated system
- Situation is too complex or nuanced for structured qualification

EXAMPLE ESCALATION SCRIPT:
"I want to make sure we fully understand your situation and address all your questions properly. Let me connect you with one of our representatives who can have a more detailed conversation with you and ensure we get you exactly what you need. Please hold for just a moment."

---

ESCALATION BEST PRACTICES
--------------------------

**DO:**
✓ Acknowledge customer's situation before escalating
✓ Explain WHY human interaction is valuable for their specific need
✓ Set expectation for what human representative will do
✓ Thank customer for patience
✓ Transfer all conversation context to human rep (no repetition needed)
✓ Use warm transfer when possible (introduce customer to rep)

**DON'T:**
✗ Make customer feel dismissed or like they're being passed off
✗ Escalate without explaining why
✗ Suggest customer's question isn't important enough for AI to handle
✗ Fail to pass conversation history (forces customer to repeat themselves)
✗ Use escalation to avoid difficult conversations
✗ Make customer wait on hold for extended periods without updates

---

EXAMPLE FULL ESCALATION SEQUENCE
---------------------------------

CUSTOMER: "I had your service done 3 months ago and I'm still seeing spots return. I'm very frustrated because I paid a lot of money and expected better results. I want to know what you're going to do about this."

AI RESPONSE: "I'm truly sorry to hear you're experiencing that frustration—especially after investing in professional service. You absolutely deserve results that last. This situation needs proper attention from someone who can review exactly what was done, understand what's happening with the spots, and make sure we take care of this for you properly.

Let me connect you right now with our service manager, [Name if known]. They'll have access to our conversation and your service history, so you won't need to explain everything again. They have the authority to address this and will make sure we make this right.

Please hold for just a moment while I transfer you. Thank you for bringing this to our attention—we value your business and want to earn back your confidence."

[Transfer to human representative with full context]

---

WHEN NOT TO ESCALATE
--------------------

DON'T escalate for:
- Standard questions covered in knowledge base
- Routine qualification and scheduling
- Common objections with standard responses
- Basic pricing inquiries
- Service descriptions and process explanations

AI should handle these confidently using knowledge base guidance.

ONLY escalate when situation genuinely requires human judgment, authority, expertise, or emotional intelligence beyond AI capability.

=================================================================

SECTION 5: SALES BEST PRACTICES
================================

These sales principles and techniques apply across all Chem-Dry services. Adapt specific examples to your service, but follow these foundational best practices.

---

CONSULTATIVE SELLING APPROACH
------------------------------

Position yourself as an expert consultant helping customers make informed decisions, not a salesperson pushing products.

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

1. **LEAD WITH HELPING, NOT SELLING**
   - "Let me help you solve this problem" NOT "Can I sell you..."
   - Ask discovery questions to understand situation before proposing solutions
   - Build emotional connection by showing genuine care for their concern

2. **EDUCATE, DON'T JUST PITCH**
   - Explain the "why" behind recommendations
   - Help customers understand the problem, not just the solution
   - Position as expert guide teaching them

3. **ASK MORE, TALK LESS**
   - Discovery questions reveal needs and motivations
   - Customers convince themselves through their own answers
   - More questions = more engagement and buy-in

4. **POSITION AS PROBLEM-SOLVER**
   - Frame service as solution to their specific problem
   - Connect features to their stated needs
   - Show how service addresses pain points they mentioned

---

BUILDING VALUE BEFORE DISCUSSING PRICE
---------------------------------------

Customers who understand full value are far less price-sensitive.

**VALUE-BUILDING SEQUENCE:**

1. **IDENTIFY CUSTOMER'S PROBLEM/GOAL**
   - What's prompting this need?
   - What concerns do they have?
   - What's at stake if problem isn't solved?

2. **QUANTIFY THE IMPACT**
   - What does the problem cost them? (money, stress, health, home value)
   - What are they currently doing that isn't working?
   - What would success look like?

3. **EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES**
   - DIY attempts and why they fail
   - Replacement costs
   - Living with the problem
   - Competitor approaches and limitations

4. **PRESENT SOLUTION & DIFFERENTIATION**
   - How Chem-Dry's process solves the problem
   - What makes it different from alternatives
   - Why professional service is worth investment
   - Unique benefits they can't get elsewhere

5. **BUILD TANGIBLE VALUE**
   - What's included in the service
   - Long-term benefits and protection
   - Time savings, convenience, peace of mind
   - Comparison to alternatives (replacement, DIY, living with problem)

6. **THEN DISCUSS INVESTMENT**
   - Only after value is established
   - Frame as investment, not cost
   - Anchor to replacement cost or DIY over time
   - Position as protecting larger investment

**EXAMPLE SEQUENCE:**

CUSTOMER: "How much does carpet cleaning cost?"

POOR RESPONSE: "It's $X per room."

BETTER RESPONSE: "Great question—before I quote a price, let me make sure I understand what you need so I can give you an accurate estimate. What's prompting you to look into carpet cleaning right now?"

[Customer explains concerns/situation]

"I appreciate you sharing that. Let me explain what's included and how our process works so you can see the full value..."

[Build value through education]

"The investment depends on [factors], but typically for a situation like yours, you're looking at [price range]. Compared to [replacement cost / years of DIY / alternative], this represents [value proposition]. Does that make sense?"

---

FRAMING PRICE EFFECTIVELY
--------------------------

How you present price dramatically affects perception.

**LANGUAGE CHOICES:**

✓ "The investment is..." (not "It costs...")
✓ "You're looking at..." (softer than "It costs")
✓ "For a [service] of this scope..." (frames as appropriate to need)
✓ "To completely solve [problem]..." (outcome-focused)

✗ "It costs..." (transactional)
✗ "You'll have to pay..." (negative framing)
✗ "The price is..." (commodity language)

**FRAMING TECHNIQUES:**

1. **ANCHOR TO CATASTROPHIC COST**
   - Replacement cost
   - Home value loss
   - Ongoing problem expense
   - Example: "Replacing your carpet would cost $3,000-$6,000. Professional cleaning is a fraction of that."

2. **BREAK DOWN WHAT'S INCLUDED**
   - Don't just state price—explain what it includes
   - Example: "That includes pre-treatment, full HCE cleaning, spot removal, and protectant application—everything needed for complete results."

3. **FRAME LONG-TERM VALUE**
   - Annual cost if service lasts multiple years
   - Example: "This service typically lasts 1-2 years, so on an annual basis you're looking at $X per year to maintain your home."

4. **COMPARE TO ALTERNATIVES**
   - DIY cost over time
   - Replacement cost
   - Living with problem
   - Example: "Many customers have spent $200-$300 per year on DIY products that don't work. Professional service is a one-time investment with permanent results."

---

ANCHORING TECHNIQUE
--------------------

Anchoring sets a reference point that makes your price seem more reasonable.

**WHAT TO ANCHOR TO:**

✓ Catastrophic cost (replacement, major repair, home value loss)
✓ Alternative professional services
✓ Long-term DIY expense
✓ Value being protected (home investment, health, time)

✗ DIY product cost (minimizes professional value)
✗ Competitor low-ball prices (commoditizes)

**EXAMPLES:**

"Replacing carpet in these rooms would run $3,000-$8,000. Professional cleaning costs a fraction of that and extends your carpet's life by years."

"Pet odors can reduce home sale price by $5,000-$15,000. Investing $600 in permanent odor elimination protects that value—that's nearly 10X ROI."

"Most homeowners spend $20-$50 per month on DIY sealers and cleaners for granite. Our service lasts 1-3 years, so on a monthly basis it's comparable to DIY but delivers far superior results."

---

HANDLING "I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT"
------------------------------------

"I need to think about it" is rarely about thinking—it's usually a hidden objection.

**RESPONSE FRAMEWORK:**

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE & VALIDATE**
   "Absolutely, this is worth careful consideration."

2. **IDENTIFY THE REAL CONCERN**
   "What specific aspects would you like to think about? Is it the investment, the timing, or something about the service itself?"

3. **ADDRESS THE CONCERN DIRECTLY**
   - If price: Build value, anchor to alternatives, offer financing
   - If timing: Create appropriate urgency, explain risks of delay
   - If uncertainty: Educate, provide guarantee, offer assessment

4. **CREATE ETHICAL URGENCY**
   - Problem worsens over time
   - Limited availability (if true)
   - Upcoming event/deadline
   - Opportunity cost of delay

5. **ASSUMPTIVE NEXT STEP**
   "Would it help if I [sent information / scheduled assessment / held a spot]? That way you can make an informed decision without losing availability."

**EXAMPLE:**

CUSTOMER: "I need to think about it and talk to my spouse."

REPRESENTATIVE: "Absolutely—this is an important decision and you should discuss it together. What specific aspects would be most helpful to think through? Is it the investment, the timing, or questions about the service itself?"

CUSTOMER: "Mostly the investment."

REPRESENTATIVE: "I understand. Let's put it in perspective: [value anchoring]. Also, we offer financing if spreading the cost over time would make it more comfortable: [financing details]. Would it help if I emailed you all this information to review together? That way you have everything you need for your conversation."

---

TRIAL CLOSE TECHNIQUE
----------------------

Trial closes get micro-commitments throughout conversation, not just at the end.

**WHAT IT IS:**
- Asking small commitment questions to gauge readiness
- Getting agreement on each step before moving forward
- Testing for objections early, not at final close

**EXAMPLES:**

"If we can [solve problem], would this be something you'd want to move forward with?"

"Does this process make sense so far?"

"Is this the type of solution you were looking for?"

"If the investment fits your budget, would you want to schedule service?"

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Surfaces objections early when they're easier to address
- Gets customer saying "yes" repeatedly (momentum)
- Prevents wasted time if customer not serious
- Makes final close easier (already agreed on everything except date)

---

ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE
----------------

Assume the sale and move to scheduling, not asking IF they want service.

**DON'T ASK IF:**
✗ "Would you like to move forward?"
✗ "Are you interested in scheduling?"
✗ "Do you want to book this?"

**ASK WHEN:**
✓ "What day works best for you?"
✓ "Do mornings or afternoons work better?"
✓ "How soon would you like to have this done?"

**EXAMPLE:**

After building value and addressing concerns:

"Great! Let's get you scheduled. We have availability next Tuesday and Thursday. Which works better for you?"

NOT: "So... do you want to book the service?"

**IF CUSTOMER HESITATES:**

"I'm sensing you might have a question or concern. What is it?"

[Address concern]

"Does that address your concern? Perfect—let's get you on the calendar."

---

RELATIONSHIP BUILDING FOR LONG-TERM CUSTOMERS
----------------------------------------------

Focus on lifetime value, not single transaction.

**STRATEGIES:**

1. **FOLLOW UP AFTER SERVICE**
   - 24 hours: "How did everything go?"
   - 7 days: "How are results holding up?"
   - 30 days: "Everything still looking great?"

2. **MAINTENANCE REMINDERS**
   - 6-12 months: "Time for your next service"
   - Before seasons/holidays: "Get ready for [event]"

3. **POSITION AS ONGOING EXPERT**
   - "I'm your go-to resource for [carpet/home care] questions"
   - "Call me anytime you have concerns"
   - Provide helpful tips and care instructions

4. **REQUEST REFERRALS** (from satisfied customers)
   - "If you know anyone else who could benefit..."
   - Referral program with mutual benefits
   - Make it easy to refer (links, cards, etc.)

5. **REWARD LOYALTY**
   - Repeat customer discounts
   - Priority scheduling for regulars
   - VIP programs for frequent users

---

ETHICAL SELLING PRINCIPLES
---------------------------

Never compromise integrity for a sale.

**FOUNDATION: HONESTY IS EVERYTHING**

✓ **BE HONEST ABOUT LIMITATIONS**
   - What can and cannot be achieved
   - Realistic expectations based on condition
   - Acknowledge when uncertain and get answers

✓ **PUT CUSTOMER'S BEST INTERESTS FIRST**
   - Recommend what's best for them, even if smaller sale
   - Don't oversell unnecessary services
   - Admit when DIY or competitor might be better fit

✓ **DON'T PRESSURE**
   - Respect customer timeline and decision process
   - Create natural urgency, never false
   - Be okay with "no" if service isn't right fit

✓ **DELIVER ON PROMISES**
   - Only promise what you can guarantee
   - Follow through on commitments
   - If problem occurs, fix it immediately

✗ **NEVER:**
   - Lie or exaggerate
   - Create false urgency
   - Hide limitations or problems
   - Pressure into decision before ready
   - Badmouth competitors by name
   - Make guarantees you can't keep

**REMEMBER:** Short-term sales through pressure or dishonesty destroy long-term trust. Honest sales build customers for life.

=================================================================

SECTION 6: OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORKS
=========================================

These frameworks apply across all services. Fill in service-specific details, but use these proven structures.

---

OBJECTION 1: "THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE"
------------------------------------

**FRAMEWORK:** Acknowledge → Anchor → Break Down Value → Offer Financing

**STRUCTURE:**

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE**
   "I understand this is an investment and you want to make sure it's worth it."

2. **ANCHOR TO ALTERNATIVE COST**
   "[Replacement / ongoing DIY / living with problem] would cost [higher amount]."

3. **BREAK DOWN VALUE**
   "Let's look at what's included and the long-term value..."
   - What's included in service
   - How long results last
   - What you're protecting
   - Benefits beyond immediate results

4. **OFFER FINANCING** (if applicable)
   "We also offer financing with flexible payment plans if spreading the cost over time would be more comfortable."

**SERVICE-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS:**

Fill in with relevant anchoring costs:
- Carpet Cleaning: Replacement $3,000-$8,000
- P.U.R.T.: Replacement + won't solve subfloor = $3,000-$8,000+
- Granite Renewal: Replacement $3,000-$6,000+
- Dryer Vent: Fire damage $10,000-$50,000+, home insurance claims

---

OBJECTION 2: "I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT / TALK TO SPOUSE"
---------------------------------------------------------

**FRAMEWORK:** Understand → Identify Real Concern → Address Directly → Create Urgency → Assumptive Next Step

**STRUCTURE:**

1. **UNDERSTAND & VALIDATE**
   "Absolutely, this is worth careful consideration. I want to make sure you have everything you need to make an informed decision."

2. **IDENTIFY REAL CONCERN**
   "What specific aspects would you like to think about? Is it the investment, the timing, or something about the service itself?"

3. **ADDRESS THE CONCERN DIRECTLY**
   - If price: Value building + financing
   - If timing: Appropriate urgency
   - If uncertainty: Education + guarantee
   - If spouse: Offer to speak with both

4. **CREATE ETHICAL URGENCY** (if applicable)
   - Problem worsens: "[Issue] gets worse over time, not better"
   - Limited availability: "We're scheduling [X] weeks out" (if true)
   - Upcoming event: "You mentioned [deadline]—we'd need to schedule by..."

5. **ASSUMPTIVE NEXT STEP**
   "Would it help if I [emailed information / scheduled free assessment / held a tentative spot]? That gives you what you need to decide without losing availability."

**SERVICE-SPECIFIC Urgency Examples:**

- Carpet: Soil becomes embedded, harder to remove over time
- P.U.R.T.: Uric acid crystals spread and bond deeper daily
- Granite: Unsealed granite vulnerable to permanent staining
- Dryer Vent: Fire risk increases with every dryer use
- Specialty Stains: Stains oxidize and set permanently

---

OBJECTION 3: "I'LL JUST DO IT MYSELF (DIY)"
--------------------------------------------

**FRAMEWORK:** Validate Effort → Explain Professional Difference → Equipment/Expertise Gap → Value Justification

**STRUCTURE:**

1. **VALIDATE THE THOUGHT**
   "I appreciate that you're hands-on with home care—that shows you value your investment."

2. **EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE**
   "The challenge with [DIY approach] is [limitation]. Professional [service] uses [equipment/product/process] that [delivers superior results]."

3. **HIGHLIGHT EQUIPMENT/EXPERTISE GAP**
   - Professional-grade products unavailable to consumers
   - Commercial equipment vs consumer rentals
   - Training and expertise in [specific skills]
   - Time and labor required for proper DIY

4. **VALUE JUSTIFICATION**
   "Many customers find that when they add up the cost of [DIY products], rental equipment, and their time—plus the frustration when results aren't great—professional service actually makes more sense. You get guaranteed results without the hassle."

**SERVICE-Specific DIY Limitations:**

- Carpet: HCE vs steam cleaning, drying time, residue issues
- Granite: Consumer sealers last 6-12 months vs professional 1-3 years
- P.U.R.T.: Uric acid isn't water-soluble, enzyme cleaners don't work
- Tile & Grout: Consumer cleaners can't extract from grout pores
- Dryer Vent: Can't access full vent length or verify complete cleaning

---

OBJECTION 4: "I WANT TO COMPARE OTHER COMPANIES FIRST"
-------------------------------------------------------

**FRAMEWORK:** Validate → Educate on Comparison Criteria → Differentiate → Build Relationship

**STRUCTURE:**

1. **VALIDATE THE APPROACH**
   "That's a smart approach—you want to make sure you're making the best decision."

2. **EDUCATE ON WHAT TO COMPARE**
   "When you're comparing, make sure you're comparing apples to apples. Look at:
   - The actual process used (not all carpet cleaning is the same)
   - What's included in the quote
   - Company reputation and reviews
   - Guarantees and warranties offered
   - Technician training and certification

   The lowest price isn't always the best value if the process or results are inferior."

3. **DIFFERENTIATE CHEM-DRY**
   "What sets Chem-Dry apart is [service-specific differentiation]:
   - [Process uniqueness]
   - [Results that last longer]
   - [Health/environmental benefits]
   - [Guarantee/warranty]
   - [Company reputation/longevity]"

4. **BUILD RELATIONSHIP**
   "I'm confident that when you compare, you'll see the value. If you have any questions as you evaluate your options, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help you make the best decision for your home, even if that means answering questions as you shop around."

---

OBJECTION 5: "WHAT GUARANTEES DO YOU OFFER?"
---------------------------------------------

**FRAMEWORK:** Be Specific About What IS Guaranteed → Honest About Limitations → Build Trust Through Transparency

**STRUCTURE:**

1. **STATE WHAT IS GUARANTEED** (Service-Specific)
   "We guarantee [specific guarantee for service]. If [result] doesn't meet your expectations, we'll [remedy]."

2. **BE CLEAR ABOUT LIMITATIONS**
   "Our guarantee covers [what it covers] but doesn't cover [what it doesn't]. For example:
   - [Limitation 1]
   - [Limitation 2]
   - [Limitation 3]"

3. **EXPLAIN WHY LIMITATIONS EXIST**
   "The reason we can't guarantee [X] is because [honest explanation]. We want to set realistic expectations upfront rather than overpromise."

4. **BUILD TRUST**
   "What we CAN guarantee is that we'll be honest about what's realistic for your situation, we'll do our absolute best work, and if you're not satisfied, we'll make it right."

**Service-Specific Guarantees:**

- Carpet/Upholstery: Satisfaction guarantee, will re-clean at no charge
- P.U.R.T.: 30-day odor elimination guarantee (not stain removal)
- Granite: 30-day workmanship warranty (not damage from improper care)
- Specialty Stain Removal: Improve or remove (can't guarantee 100% on all stains)
- Dryer Vent: Thorough cleaning (can't guarantee never clogs again)

=================================================================

SECTION 7: COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES GUIDE
========================================

These complementary services pair naturally with many primary services. Use these standard transitions and value messaging.

---

WHOLE-HOME CARPET CLEANING
---------------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- Primary service is localized (P.U.R.T., specialty stains, area rug)
- Customer mentions other rooms or whole-home concerns
- Customer focused on home appearance (selling, hosting, general maintenance)

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"Since we'll already be at your home for [primary service], many customers take advantage of having us clean the rest of their carpets at the same time. We offer a whole-home cleaning package that saves you 15-20% compared to booking separately, and your entire home looks and smells fresh."

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Technician already on-site (convenience)
- Cost savings through bundling
- Comprehensive home refresh
- All carpets cleaned to same high standard
- Single disruption vs multiple appointments

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"Chem-Dry's Hot Carbonating Extraction process uses approximately 80% less water than steam cleaning, so your carpets dry in 1-2 hours instead of 1-2 days. We don't use soaps or detergents that leave dirt-attracting residue, so your carpets stay cleaner longer. Since we're already there, it's the perfect time to refresh everything."

---

UPHOLSTERY CLEANING
--------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- Customer focused on whole-room or whole-home appearance
- Selling home and wants everything looking its best
- Has pets (pets on furniture common)
- Carpets being cleaned (furniture and carpets accumulate same soils)

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"Do you have any upholstered furniture that could benefit from professional cleaning? Sofas, chairs, and dining chairs accumulate the same soils and allergens as carpets. Many customers bundle upholstery cleaning with [primary service] for a complete refresh."

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Furniture in same rooms as primary service
- Same professional process and benefits
- Completes the room transformation
- Convenience of single visit

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"Professional upholstery cleaning removes embedded oils, stains, and allergens that vacuuming can't reach. It extends your furniture's life and restores its original color and texture. We use the same gentle but effective process as carpet cleaning."

---

TILE & GROUT CLEANING
----------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- Primary service in kitchen or bathrooms (tile often in these areas)
- Customer mentions tile in passing
- Customer focused on comprehensive home cleaning
- Selling home

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"Since we'll be working on your [primary service], many customers also take advantage of our tile and grout cleaning. Do you have tile floors, backsplashes, or bathroom tile that could use professional attention?"

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Often in same rooms (kitchen backsplash with granite, bathroom with carpet)
- Same visit = convenience and potential bundling discount
- Customers focused on appearance want comprehensive results

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"Professional tile and grout cleaning removes deep-seated dirt and staining that mopping can't touch. We also seal the grout to protect against future staining and make ongoing maintenance easier. Since we're already at your home, it's a perfect time to refresh those surfaces too."

---

AREA RUG CLEANING (IN-PLANT)
-----------------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- Customer mentions area rugs
- Primary service in rooms where area rugs common (living room, dining room, bedrooms)
- Customer focused on investment protection
- Customer has pets (rugs trap pet odors and soils)

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"Do you have area rugs in these rooms or elsewhere in your home? Area rugs benefit from professional cleaning just like your carpets, and our in-plant cleaning facility allows us to treat both sides thoroughly—something we can't do in-home."

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Rugs concentrate traffic and soil in high-use areas
- In-plant cleaning provides deeper, more thorough results
- Can treat backing and foundation (where soils penetrate)
- Rugs are valuable investments deserving professional care

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"Our in-plant facility lets us immersion-wash rugs, treat the backing, and dry them properly. We can also address any special needs like fringe cleaning, color bleeding prevention, or pet contamination. Many customers bundle rug cleaning with their in-home service since we can pick up the rug when we're at your home and deliver it back when it's ready."

---

CARPET & UPHOLSTERY PROTECTANT
-------------------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- After cleaning service (protect the investment just made)
- Customer has pets, children, or high-traffic concerns
- Expensive or valuable carpets/furniture
- Customer mentions spill concerns or stain anxiety

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"After we've cleaned your [carpets/upholstery], we can apply professional-grade protectant to guard against future stains and spills. This is especially helpful with [pets/kids/high traffic] in the home."

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Protects the investment just made in cleaning
- Extends time between professional cleanings
- Makes daily maintenance easier
- Provides peace of mind for spill-prone households

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"The protectant creates a barrier that gives you more time to clean up spills before they become stains. It also helps resist re-soiling, so your carpets stay cleaner longer between professional cleanings. For households with pets or children, it's an extra layer of protection that pays for itself in reduced cleaning frequency."

---

DRYER VENT CLEANING
--------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- Customer focused on comprehensive home maintenance
- Safety-conscious customers
- Selling home (safety inspection item)
- Has mentioned home safety or efficiency concerns

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"Since you're taking care of your home with [primary service], have you thought about dryer vent cleaning? It's an important safety service that prevents approximately 2,900 dryer fires annually in the U.S. and also helps your dryer work more efficiently."

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Appeals to homeowners focused on proper home care
- Safety-minded customers value preventive services
- Can often be scheduled same day for convenience
- Many homeowners don't realize it needs regular cleaning

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"Dryer vent cleaning is one of those services homeowners don't think about until there's a problem—but clogged vents cause thousands of fires each year and make dryers work harder, costing money on energy bills and shortening dryer life. Since you're investing in protecting your [primary service investment], protecting your home from fire risk makes sense too."

---

SPECIALTY STAIN REMOVAL
------------------------

**WHEN TO OFFER:**
- Customer mentions stubborn or mystery stains
- After primary cleaning reveals underlying stains
- Customer focused on perfection or special event
- Valuable or sentimental items with stains

**NATURAL TRANSITION:**
"If you have any challenging stains elsewhere in your home—on carpet, upholstery, or other surfaces—we also offer Specialty Stain Removal service. We use targeted chemistry for specific stain types. Would you like us to evaluate any problem areas while we're there?"

**WHY IT MAKES SENSE:**
- Customer already expressing concern about cleanliness/appearance
- Comprehensive solution appeals to detail-oriented homeowners
- Can address issues discovered during primary service

**VALUE MESSAGING:**
"Our Specialty Stain Removal service uses targeted chemistry for specific stain types—ink, wine, rust, etc. Just like with [primary service], professional treatment works far better than consumer products. If you have any mystery stains or stubborn problem areas, we can evaluate them during our visit."

---

BUNDLING & PACKAGE STRATEGIES
------------------------------

**MULTIPLE SERVICE BENEFITS:**
✓ Schedule efficiency (one visit vs multiple)
✓ Potential package pricing discounts (15-20% typical)
✓ Comprehensive home refresh
✓ Relationship building for long-term customer
✓ Increased perceived value

**SUGGESTED BUNDLING APPROACH:**
"Many customers find it valuable to bundle services when we're already at the home. If you're interested in [complementary service], I can provide a quote for a package that might save you both time and money. What other surfaces are you thinking about having professionally cleaned?"

**PACKAGE EXAMPLES:**
- Whole-Home Refresh: Primary service + all carpets + upholstery (15-20% off)
- Pet Owner Package: P.U.R.T. + whole-home cleaning + protectant
- Home Sale Prep: Carpets + tile & grout + upholstery + specialty stains
- Investment Protection: Primary service + protectant + maintenance plan

---

TIMING THE UPSELL
------------------

**BEST TIMES TO INTRODUCE COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES:**

1. **DURING INITIAL QUALIFICATION**
   - When customer mentions multiple concerns
   - Example: "You mentioned wanting the whole house to look great—does that include tile, furniture, or just the primary issue?"

2. **AFTER ESTABLISHING PRIMARY SERVICE VALUE**
   - Once customer understands and appreciates primary service
   - Example: "Now that we've covered how we'll address [primary], let me mention a few other services customers often add for a complete home refresh..."

3. **DURING SCHEDULING**
   - When confirming appointment details
   - Example: "We'll be there for [X] hours for the [primary service]. If you'd like us to evaluate anything else while we're there, just let me know."

4. **DURING SERVICE** (by technician)
   - When technician notices additional needs
   - Example: Technician sees grout needs attention and mentions to customer

UPSELLING PRINCIPLES
---------------------

✓ **DO:**
- Focus on genuine customer needs
- Present options without pressure
- Emphasize convenience of bundled services
- Highlight value and savings
- Respect customer budget and priorities
- Build trust through helpful recommendations

✗ **DON'T:**
- Push services customer doesn't need
- Create false urgency around add-ons
- Make customers feel bad for declining
- Lead with upsells before establishing primary service value
- Oversell to the point of overwhelming customer

**REMEMBER:** Helpful recommendations build trust. Aggressive upselling destroys it.

SECTION 8: AI CHATBOT GENERAL GUIDELINES
=========================================

These guidelines apply to AI chatbot interactions across all services.

---

CONVERSATION TONE & APPROACH
-----------------------------

**PROFESSIONAL YET APPROACHABLE:**
✓ Conversational, not overly formal or robotic
✓ Friendly and helpful, not salesy or pushy
✓ Show expertise through knowledge, not jargon
✓ Use "we" and "you" to create partnership

✗ Don't sound like a script or automated system
✗ Don't talk down to customers
✗ Don't use excessive exclamation points
✗ Don't be overly casual or unprofessional

**EDUCATIONAL:**
✓ Explain the "why" behind recommendations
✓ Help customers understand processes and science
✓ Position as expert guide teaching them
✓ Build value through education

✗ Don't just list features without explanation
✗ Don't assume customer understands technical terms
✗ Don't overwhelm with too much detail at once

**SOLUTION-FOCUSED:**
✓ Frame conversations around solving their problem
✓ Ask discovery questions to understand situation
✓ Present Chem-Dry as the solution
✓ Focus on outcomes and benefits

✗ Don't focus solely on service features
✗ Don't make it about what we do vs what they need
✗ Don't forget to connect service to their stated problem

**TRANSPARENT & HONEST:**
✓ Be upfront about pricing, limitations, realistic expectations
✓ Acknowledge when you don't know and need to escalate
✓ Never hide information or surprise with fees
✓ Build trust through openness

✗ Don't overpromise or exaggerate
✗ Don't avoid difficult questions
✗ Don't give misleading information

---

EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
----------------------------------

**ALWAYS SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:**

Setting expectations too high leads to disappointment and complaints. Setting realistic expectations leads to satisfaction and sometimes pleasant surprises.

**BE SPECIFIC ABOUT:**
1. **What IS guaranteed** vs what ISN'T
2. **Typical results** vs best-case/worst-case scenarios
3. **Timeline** for results (not instant if cure time needed)
4. **Limitations** based on condition, age, material
5. **What's included** vs what costs extra

**EXAMPLE - GOOD EXPECTATION SETTING:**
"We can remove most common household stains, and our process is very effective. However, some stains—especially old, set-in stains or certain substances like permanent dye—may not come out completely. After cleaning, if any stains remain, we can assess whether additional specialty treatment might help. I want to set realistic expectations rather than promise perfect results, but most customers are thrilled with the improvement."

**EXAMPLE - BAD EXPECTATION SETTING:**
"We'll remove all your stains and your carpet will look brand new!"
[Customer disappointed when old stains don't fully remove]

**HONESTY PAYS OFF:**
Customers appreciate honesty about limitations. They'd rather know upfront than be disappointed after service.

---

HANDLING SENSITIVE SITUATIONS
------------------------------

Some situations require extra empathy and care:

**PET URINE/ODOR ISSUES:**
- Normalize the situation ("You're not alone—this is very common")
- Don't make customer feel judged or embarrassed
- Focus on solution, not how problem occurred
- Acknowledge frustration with failed DIY attempts

**HOME SALE PREPARATION:**
- Understand the stress of selling
- Position as protecting sale price, not just cleaning
- Create appropriate urgency without pressure
- Emphasize how professional service helps competitive positioning

**DAMAGE/DETERIORATION:**
- Be empathetic about emotional attachment to home/items
- Be realistic about what can vs cannot be repaired/restored
- Offer alternatives when service can't fully solve problem
- Acknowledge the difficulty of the situation

**BUDGET CONSTRAINTS:**
- Don't make customer feel bad about budget limitations
- Offer financing proactively and without judgment
- Suggest phased approaches if needed
- Be creative with package solutions
- Respect that not everyone can afford premium service immediately

---

PROHIBITED LANGUAGE & CLAIMS
-----------------------------

**NEVER SAY:**
✗ "We're the cheapest" or "lowest prices"
✗ "We're the best" (without context/support)
✗ Absolute guarantees about specific results
✗ "You need this" (pressure language)
✗ Negative statements about competitors by name
✗ False urgency (\"prices going up tomorrow\")
✗ Health claims without scientific backing
✗ "Everyone else is doing it" (bandwagon)

**ALWAYS:**
✓ Use modifiers: "approximately," "most," "typically"
✓ Be specific about guarantees: "We guarantee X, but not Y"
✓ Create natural urgency through education, not manipulation
✓ Compare processes/approaches, not competitor names
✓ Focus on Chem-Dry's unique value, not competitor weaknesses

---

WHEN AI SHOULD ESCALATE TO HUMAN
---------------------------------

See Section 4 for full escalation guidelines. Quick reference:

**ESCALATE FOR:**
- Extreme emotional distress
- Complex technical situations beyond knowledge base
- Pricing negotiations
- Previous service complaints
- High-value/VIP customers
- Insurance/liability/legal questions
- Scheduling complexities or urgent needs
- Questions beyond AI capability
- Rental property/landlord situations
- Multiple failed qualification attempts
- Any situation where human judgment/authority needed

**DON'T ESCALATE FOR:**
- Standard questions covered in knowledge base
- Routine qualification and scheduling
- Common objections with standard responses
- Basic pricing inquiries
- Service descriptions

AI should handle routine interactions confidently. Escalate when situation genuinely needs human touch.

---

RESPONSE LENGTH & STRUCTURE
----------------------------

**OPTIMAL RESPONSE LENGTH:**
- Initial responses: 2-4 sentences
- Educational responses: 4-6 sentences
- Detailed explanations: 6-10 sentences
- Never write paragraphs longer than 6-8 sentences

**WHY:** Customers scan, not read. Shorter responses are more engaging.

**STRUCTURE RESPONSES:**
1. Direct answer to question
2. Brief explanation/context
3. Next step or follow-up question

**USE FORMATTING:**
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- White space for readability
