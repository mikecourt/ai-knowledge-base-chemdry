1. SERVICE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

WHAT IS TILE AND GROUT CLEANING?
The Tile, Stone & Grout Cleaning service from Chem-Dry restores the beauty and
cleanliness of tile and grout surfaces throughout the home. Using specialized
equipment and cleaning solutions, this service removes deeply embedded dirt,
grime, and bacteria that regular mopping can't reach.

KEY BENEFITS:
• Removes deeply embedded dirt and grime from porous grout
• Restores original brightness and color to grout lines
• Eliminates bacteria, mold, and mildew in grout
• Professional equipment reaches what mopping can't
• Optional sealing protects grout from future staining
• Extends the life of tile and grout investment
• Healthier, more hygienic floors
• Enhanced appearance of entire room

COMMON APPLICATIONS:
• Kitchen floors and backsplashes
• Bathroom floors, showers, and tub surrounds
• Entryways and mudrooms
• Laundry rooms
• Sunrooms and enclosed porches
• Commercial facilities (restaurants, retail, offices)

WHY GROUT GETS DIRTY:
Grout is porous and absorbs:
• Dirt and soil tracked in from outside
• Spills and stains from cooking, bathing, etc.
• Mop water (which spreads dirt around)
• Oils and residues from cleaning products
• Moisture that promotes mold/mildew growth

Regular mopping only cleans the surface - dirt embeds deep in grout pores,
causing discoloration and deterioration over time.

================================================================================
4. TILE AND GROUT SCIENCE
================================================================================

WHY PROFESSIONAL CLEANING IS NECESSARY:

GROUT POROSITY:
• Grout is cement-based and highly porous
• Pores absorb dirt, oils, moisture, and stains
• Surface cleaning (mopping) doesn't reach embedded soil
• Over time, embedded dirt causes permanent discoloration

LIMITATIONS OF MOPPING:
• Spreads dirty water across surface
• Pushes soil deeper into grout pores
• Leaves residue that attracts more dirt
• Cannot generate enough pressure to extract embedded soil
• Often uses incorrect pH cleaners that damage grout

PROFESSIONAL ADVANTAGES:
• High-pressure extraction reaches deep into pores
• Specialized solutions break down embedded oils and soil
• Hot water enhances cleaning effectiveness
• Powerful vacuum extraction removes dirty water completely
• No dirt-attracting residue left behind
• Appropriate solutions for each tile/grout type

THE IMPORTANCE OF SEALING:
Unsealed grout acts like a sponge:
• Absorbs spills and stains immediately
• Provides environment for mold/mildew growth
• Deteriorates faster from moisture penetration
• Requires more frequent professional cleaning

Sealed grout creates a protective barrier:
• Repels liquids and prevents stain absorption
• Inhibits mold and mildew growth
• Easier to maintain with routine mopping
• Extends grout lifespan significantly
• Maintains clean appearance longer between professional cleanings

NATURAL STONE CONSIDERATIONS:
Stone surfaces require special care:
• More porous than ceramic/porcelain
• Can be damaged by acidic or harsh cleaners
• May require lower pressure cleaning
• Often need specialized stone sealers
• Professional cleaning prevents etching and damage

================================================================================

6. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

SERVICE QUESTIONS:

Q: How long does the service take?
A: Most tile and grout cleaning jobs take 1-3 hours depending on size and
condition. A small bathroom might take 45-60 minutes, while a large kitchen
could take 2-3 hours. We'll give you a more accurate timeframe after assessing
your specific situation. If you're adding grout sealing, that adds about 30-45
minutes plus drying time.

Q: How often should I have my tile and grout professionally cleaned?
A: For most homes, we recommend professional cleaning every 1-2 years. High-
traffic areas (kitchen, entryway) may benefit from annual cleaning. If you have
sealed grout, you can extend to every 2 years. Commercial facilities typically
need quarterly or semi-annual cleaning.

Q: Will the cleaning damage my tile or grout?
A: Absolutely not. Our technicians are trained to use appropriate pressure and
solutions for each tile type. We test questionable areas before starting and
adjust our methods for delicate surfaces like natural stone. Our process is
safe and effective for all tile and grout types.

Q: Can you remove all stains from my grout?
A: We can remove most stains, but some deeply set stains (especially in very
old, unsealed grout) may be permanent. In these cases, we offer color sealing
which changes the grout color to a fresh, uniform appearance while providing
maximum protection.

Q: Do I need to seal my grout?
A: We highly recommend it. Sealing creates a protective barrier that prevents
stains, moisture damage, and mold growth. It makes routine cleaning much easier
and extends the time between professional cleanings. For the small additional
cost, it provides significant long-term value.

Q: How long before I can walk on the floor after cleaning?
A: For cleaning only, floors are typically dry enough to walk on within 1-2
hours. If you add grout sealing, we recommend waiting 24-48 hours before heavy
traffic to allow the sealer to cure fully. Light foot traffic is fine after a
few hours.

Q: Can you clean shower walls and tub surrounds?
A: Yes! Vertical surfaces require specialized techniques, and pricing is
typically higher than floors due to the additional difficulty. We clean shower
walls, tub surrounds, backsplashes, and any tiled vertical surface.

Q: What's the difference between standard sealing and color sealing?
A: Standard sealing creates a clear protective barrier over your existing grout
color. It prevents stains and moisture but doesn't change the appearance. Color
sealing applies a pigmented sealer that changes the grout color to your choice
(often a uniform neutral tone), covering existing stains while providing
maximum protection. Color sealing is more expensive but gives a "like new"
appearance.

PRICING & VALUE QUESTIONS:

Q: Why is professional tile cleaning so much more expensive than DIY?
A: Professional equipment costs $15,000-30,000 and provides far superior
results. Our specialized solutions are designed for tile and grout (not generic
cleaners), our technicians have years of training, and you get guaranteed
results. Most importantly, our cleaning lasts much longer - you'll actually
save money over time compared to repeatedly renting equipment and spending your
weekends scrubbing.

Q: Do you charge by the room or by square footage?
A: We price by square footage, which ensures you only pay for what we actually
clean. A "room" can vary dramatically in size, so square footage is more fair
and transparent. We measure on-site to provide accurate pricing.

Q: Is there a minimum charge?
A: Most franchises have a minimum service charge (typically $75-150) to cover
travel time and setup costs. This is waived for larger jobs. Ask about bundling
with other services (carpet cleaning, upholstery) to maximize value.

Q: Are there any hidden fees?
A: No. We provide transparent pricing after measuring your space. The only
additional charges would be for services you request (like grout sealing) which
we discuss upfront. There are no surprise fees.

Q: Do you offer any guarantees?
A: Yes! All Chem-Dry services come with a satisfaction guarantee. If you're not
happy with the results, let us know within 30 days and we'll make it right.
That might mean re-cleaning specific areas or working with you to resolve any
concerns.

PROCESS & PREPARATION QUESTIONS:

Q: Do I need to move furniture?
A: We ask that you remove small items, rugs, and easily movable furniture. For
heavy furniture (refrigerators, stoves, washers), we can work around them or
help move them if needed. Just let us know in advance.

Q: What do I need to do to prepare?
A: Clear floor surfaces of loose items, secure pets in a separate area, and
make sure we have access to water and electricity. Remove any rugs or mats from
tile areas. That's it - we handle the rest!

Q: Will there be any odor or fumes?
A: Our cleaning solutions are low-odor and safe. You may notice a mild, clean
scent during and immediately after service, but it dissipates quickly. We don't
use harsh chemicals with strong fumes.

Q: Can you clean while I'm not home?
A: Some customers prefer this arrangement. We'd need access to the home and
clear communication about what areas to clean. Most people prefer to be present
for the initial walkthrough and final inspection, but we're flexible.

Q: What if I have pets?
A: Our cleaning solutions are pet-safe once dry. During service, we ask that
you secure pets in a separate area for their safety and to allow our
technicians to work efficiently. Pets can return to cleaned areas once floors
are dry.

RESULTS & MAINTENANCE QUESTIONS:

Q: How can I maintain my tile and grout between professional cleanings?
A:
• Use a pH-neutral tile cleaner (not acidic or alkaline)
• Sweep or vacuum regularly to prevent dirt buildup
• Wipe up spills immediately
• Damp mop (don't flood the floor)
• Change mop water frequently
• Avoid oil-based or waxy cleaners
• Consider annual re-sealing

Q: Will my grout return to its original color?
A: In most cases, yes! Professional cleaning removes the embedded dirt causing
discoloration. However, very old grout or grout that's been deeply stained for
many years may have permanent discoloration. Color sealing is an excellent
option for these situations.

Q: How long will the cleaning results last?
A: With proper maintenance, most customers find results last 1-2 years. Sealed
grout stays cleaner longer (2-3 years). High-traffic areas may show soiling
sooner. Regular sweeping and proper mopping significantly extend the life of
professional cleaning.

Q: Can you remove mold and mildew from shower grout?
A: Yes. Our cleaning process kills mold and mildew while removing visible
staining. For chronic mold problems, we recommend grout sealing after cleaning
to prevent moisture penetration. In some cases, improving bathroom ventilation
is also important.

================================================================================
7. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS
================================================================================

OBJECTION: "That seems expensive for just cleaning."

Response: "I understand it may seem that way at first, but let's put it in
perspective. Professional tile and grout cleaning costs about $0.50 per square
foot for a kitchen floor - that's around $75-150 for most kitchens. Compare
that to regrouting at $5-15 per square foot ($750-2,250) or replacement at
$15-30 per square foot ($2,250-4,500). Regular professional maintenance
actually saves you thousands of dollars by preventing the need for replacement.
Plus, our specialized equipment and solutions achieve results that renting a
machine simply can't match."

Alternative: "Let me break down what you're really paying for: We use $20,000
professional equipment, specialized solutions designed specifically for your
tile type, certified technicians with years of training, and we guarantee our
results. Compare that to renting a machine for $50-60, buying generic cleaners,
spending your entire weekend scrubbing, and still not getting professional
results. Which sounds like better value?"

---

OBJECTION: "I can just rent a machine and do it myself."

Response: "You certainly could, and many people try that route initially. Here's
what typically happens: The rental machines have about 1/4 the power of our
professional equipment, you'll spend 6-8 hours of hard physical labor, and the
results last about half as long because the embedded dirt isn't fully removed.
Most people who rent machines tell us they wish they'd called us first. You'll
spend $75-125 on rental and supplies, sacrifice your weekend, and likely need
professional cleaning sooner anyway. Our service takes 1.5-3 hours, gets deeper
results, and comes with a guarantee. Is saving $50-75 worth losing your weekend
and getting inferior results?"

Alternative: "I appreciate the DIY spirit! Here's the challenge: Our extraction
equipment generates 1200+ PSI and 200+ degree water temperature, which rental
machines can't match. We also use pH-specific solutions for your exact tile
type - stone requires different chemistry than ceramic. Many customers who try
DIY first end up calling us to fix damage from incorrect products or to finish
what the rental machine couldn't handle. You'll actually save time and money by
doing it right the first time."

---

OBJECTION: "I just had my floors cleaned last year."

Response: "That's great that you're taking care of your floors! If you had them
professionally cleaned last year and they're already looking dirty again, that
might indicate the previous service left residue behind that's attracting dirt.
Our Hot Carbonating Extraction process leaves no dirt-attracting residue, so
results last much longer. If your floors were sealed last time, you might not
need full cleaning yet - just a maintenance clean or re-sealing. Let me ask:
Did you have grout sealing done, or just cleaning?"

Alternative: "If you had professional cleaning just a year ago and you're
already seeing significant soiling, that suggests either very high traffic,
residue from the previous cleaning, or that the grout wasn't sealed. With our
process and proper sealing, most customers go 2-3 years between cleanings.
Would you like us to assess whether you need full cleaning or just touch-up
work?"

---

OBJECTION: "My grout is too far gone to be saved."

Response: "I hear that a lot, and I understand why it seems that way! Here's
the good news: What looks like permanently black or discolored grout is usually
years of embedded dirt, oils, and grime. Our high-pressure extraction reaches
deep into the grout pores and removes that buildup. I've seen grout that
customers thought was black turn out to be light gray or even white underneath
all that dirt. If cleaning doesn't restore it completely, we offer color
sealing which changes your grout to any color you choose - it'll look brand new
and be protected against future staining. Either way, we can transform your
floors."

Alternative: "That's actually the perfect situation for our service. The worse
the condition, the more dramatic the results! Even if some staining is
permanent, our color sealing option gives you a completely fresh appearance -
you choose the grout color, we apply a pigmented sealer, and your grout looks
uniform and new. It's a fraction of the cost of regrouting and provides maximum
protection. Can I show you some before-and-after photos of severe cases we've
restored?"

---

OBJECTION: "I need to think about it / talk to my spouse."

Response: "Absolutely, I completely understand - this is an investment in your
home and you should feel confident about the decision. While you're thinking it
over, is there any specific concern I can address? Is it about pricing, the
process, results expectations, or scheduling? I want to make sure you have all
the information you need to make the best decision."

[Listen to concerns and address them]

"Also, I should mention that we're currently running [seasonal promotion /
referral incentive / first-time customer discount], but that offer ends [date].
If you decide to move forward, I'd hate for you to miss out on the savings. Can
I put you down for a tentative appointment while you discuss it? There's no
obligation, and you can always cancel or reschedule."

Alternative: "That makes perfect sense. Many couples like to discuss home
service decisions together. To help with your conversation, let me send you a
detailed written estimate along with some before-and-after photos and customer
testimonials. Is there anything specific your spouse would want to know about?
Also, we're offering [current promotion] through [date], so if you decide to go
ahead, I can lock in that pricing for you. Would [date/time] work for a
tentative booking while you decide?"

---

OBJECTION: "I've had tile cleaning before and wasn't impressed."

Response: "I'm sorry you had a disappointing experience. Can you tell me what
specifically didn't meet your expectations - was it the results, the process,
how long it lasted, or something else?"

[Listen carefully to their specific complaint]

"Here's how we're different: [Address their specific concern with Chem-Dry's
approach]. For example, many companies use steam cleaners that leave moisture
behind, promoting mold growth. We use Hot Carbonating Extraction with powerful
extraction - floors dry in 1-2 hours and we don't leave residue behind. We also
offer a satisfaction guarantee: if you're not happy with the results within 30
days, we'll make it right. You literally have nothing to lose except dirty
grout. Can I schedule a free assessment so you can see the Chem-Dry difference?"

Alternative: "That's exactly why choosing the right company matters. Not all
tile cleaning is created equal. May I ask who did the previous service and what
disappointed you? [Listen] The most common issues we see from competitors are
using too-low pressure (doesn't extract embedded dirt), harsh chemicals (damage
grout over time), or leaving soap residue (attracts dirt quickly). Chem-Dry's
process is fundamentally different - we've been perfecting it for over 40 years.
We'd love the chance to show you what professional-grade tile cleaning should
look like, backed by our guarantee."

---

OBJECTION: "Can you give me a discount?"

Response: "I appreciate you asking. Our pricing reflects the value of
professional-grade equipment, certified technicians, specialized solutions for
your specific tile type, and our satisfaction guarantee. That said, we do have
several ways to maximize value: We offer multi-room discounts (10-20% off for
larger jobs), bundle pricing if you combine services (tile cleaning + carpet
cleaning saves 10-15%), and referral credits for future services. We also have
financing options if you'd like to spread the payment out. Which of those would
work best for your situation?"

Alternative: "Our pricing is based on fair value for professional service, but
I can definitely help you save money. Are you considering cleaning additional
rooms? Bundling multiple areas together gets you a progressive discount - 3+
rooms saves 15-20%. We also run seasonal promotions, and I can check if there's
a current offer you qualify for. Another option is our maintenance program -
prepay for annual service and lock in lower pricing with priority scheduling.
Would any of those approaches help make this work for your budget?"

---

OBJECTION: "I need to save up / can't afford it right now."

Response: "I completely understand - timing matters. The good news is we offer
several flexible payment options. Many customers use our financing through
[Synchrony/Greensky], which offers no-interest payment plans if paid within 6-
12 months. That breaks a $200 service down to about $20-35 per month. We also
accept all major credit cards if you prefer to use rewards points or cashback.
Would one of those options help make this doable now rather than waiting?"

Alternative: "I appreciate the honesty. Here's something to consider: Waiting
actually costs you more in the long run. As dirt embeds deeper into grout over
time, it becomes harder (and more expensive) to remove. Eventually, you're
looking at regrouting ($5-15 per sq ft) instead of cleaning ($0.50 per sq ft).
The sooner you clean and seal, the less total cost you'll have. With our
financing options, you could spread a $150 service into $15/month payments -
less than eating out twice. Which makes more financial sense: small monthly
payments now or a much larger bill for regrouting later?"

---

OBJECTION: "I'll just wait until I'm ready to sell my house."

Response: "I understand the thinking, but here's why that actually costs you
more: First, you're living with dirty, stained floors for months or years when
you could be enjoying clean, beautiful tile. Second, the longer you wait, the
deeper the stains set, potentially requiring color sealing or regrouting instead
of simple cleaning. Third, you're missing out on the health benefits - clean
grout means fewer bacteria, allergens, and mold in your home. And finally, when
you do sell, buyers notice everything - clean, maintained floors suggest a well-
cared-for home and can impact your selling price by 1-3%. Why not enjoy the
benefits yourself and protect your investment rather than only cleaning for the
next owner's benefit?"

Alternative: "That's one approach, but consider this: The average family lives
in their home for 7-13 years. That's a long time to live with floors you're
embarrassed by when guests visit. Plus, proper maintenance (cleaning + sealing
every 1-2 years) actually increases your home's value more than a one-time pre-
sale cleaning. Buyers can tell the difference between 'cleaned to sell' and
'consistently maintained.' Our service costs about $0.50/day if you're staying
another year - isn't that worth enjoying your own home?"

For complete brand voice guidelines, prohibited language, and messaging standards, refer to the Foundation document.

AI CONVERSATION FLOW FOR TILE AND GROUT:

Initial Inquiry Recognition:
• "I need my tile cleaned"
• "Tile and grout cleaning"
• "Can you clean grout?"
• "Kitchen tile cleaning"

AI Response Template:
"I'd be happy to help with information about Chem-Dry's tile and grout cleaning
service! To provide the most accurate information, may I ask:
• Which rooms or areas are you looking to have cleaned? (Kitchen, bathrooms,
  entryway, etc.)
• Approximately how many square feet of tile? (Or we can measure on-site)
• How long since your tile was last professionally cleaned?
• Are you interested in grout sealing for long-term protection?"

Qualification Questions (AI gathers info before transfer):
1. Type of tile? (Ceramic, porcelain, natural stone)
2. Size of area(s) to be cleaned?
3. Soil level: Light, moderate, or heavy soiling?
4. Any specific problem areas or stains?
5. Interest in grout sealing?
6. Timeline for service?

Information Sharing Phase:
• Explain Hot Carbonating Extraction benefits for tile/grout
• Discuss typical pricing range based on their square footage
• Mention service duration (1-3 hours typical)
• Highlight grout sealing benefits
• Share guarantee and satisfaction policy

Pricing Guidance for AI:
When customers ask about pricing, provide ranges based on size:
• Small bathroom (50 sq ft): "$40-60 for cleaning, or $55-75 with sealing"
• Kitchen floor (150 sq ft): "$75-150 for cleaning, or $105-195 with sealing"
• Master bath (100 sq ft): "$100-175 for cleaning, or $135-225 with sealing"
• Whole home (400 sq ft): "$200-300 for cleaning, or $260-390 with sealing"

Always add: "Final pricing depends on exact square footage and soil level,
which we'll assess during the free in-home inspection."

Handling Common Questions:
• "How long does it take?" → "Most jobs take 1-3 hours depending on size. Small
  bathroom 45-60 minutes, large kitchen 2-3 hours."
• "How long to dry?" → "Floors dry in 1-2 hours for cleaning only. If you add
  grout sealing, wait 24-48 hours before heavy traffic."
• "How often needed?" → "Every 1-2 years for most homes. High-traffic areas
  may benefit from annual cleaning."
• "Can you clean natural stone?" → "Yes! We use specialized solutions and
  techniques appropriate for marble, granite, travertine, and other stone
  surfaces."

Transfer to Human Representative:
AI should transfer when:
• Customer requests specific appointment scheduling
• Complex situations (severe damage, insurance claims, unusual tile types)
• Customer expresses frustration or complex concerns
• High-value sales opportunity (whole home cleaning + sealing + other services)
• Customer specifically asks to speak with a person

Transfer Script:
"I'd like to connect you with one of our tile and grout specialists who can
provide a detailed quote and schedule your service. They'll be able to answer
any specific questions about your situation and book your appointment. One
moment please..."

TONE AND STYLE:
• Professional but friendly and conversational
• Confident in Chem-Dry's capabilities and track record
• Educational - help customers understand why professional cleaning matters
• Non-pushy - focus on value and customer needs
• Accurate - never guess at pricing or make promises outside guidelines

WHAT AI SHOULD NOT DO:
• Guarantee specific stain removal results
• Diagnose tile/grout damage without professional assessment
• Provide exact pricing without square footage measurement
• Make promises about service availability or timing
• Contradict brand guidelines on possessive usage, water claims, or residue

================================================================================
9. SALES BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

CONSULTATIVE SELLING APPROACH:

Instead of "selling tile cleaning," position yourself as a home maintenance
consultant helping customers protect their flooring investment.

Discovery Questions:
1. "How long have you lived here / had these tile floors?"
2. "When was the last professional cleaning?"
3. "What areas are you most concerned about?"
4. "Are you seeing any discoloration or mold in grout lines?"
5. "Have you had grout sealed in the past?"
6. "Is this for routine maintenance or preparing for an event?"
7. "Are there other flooring types in your home we should discuss?"

Listen for Pain Points:
• Embarrassment about floor appearance
• Frustration with inability to get grout clean
• Health concerns (allergies, asthma, small children)
• Upcoming events (holidays, parties, home sale)
• Time constraints (too busy for DIY)
• Previous bad experiences with other companies

Match Solution to Pain:
• Embarrassment → Before/after photos + quick turnaround
• Frustration → Demonstrate equipment superiority + guarantee
• Health concerns → Emphasize bacteria/mold removal stats
• Event preparation → Offer priority scheduling
• Time constraints → Highlight speed and convenience
• Bad experiences → Differentiate Chem-Dry process + satisfaction guarantee

VALUE STACKING TECHNIQUE:

Instead of defending price, stack value:

"Here's what you're getting with Chem-Dry's tile and grout service:
• Professional-grade equipment worth $20,000+ [$50 value if you rented similar]
• Certified technician with years of training [$100+ value for expertise]
• Specialized solutions for your specific tile type [$30 value vs. generic
  cleaners]
• Grout sealing that protects for 1-2 years [$80-120 value]
• Satisfaction guarantee backed by national franchise [Priceless - peace of
  mind]
• 3-6 hours of your time saved [Your weekend back]
• Results that last 2-3x longer than DIY [$75-125 in delayed future cleaning]

Total value: $400-500+ for an investment of $150-250. Plus, you're preventing
$2,000-4,000 in future regrouting or replacement costs."

ASSUMPTIVE CLOSING:

After addressing objections and establishing value, use assumptive language:

Instead of: "Would you like to schedule?"
Use: "Let's get you scheduled. Do mornings or afternoons work better for you?"

Instead of: "Are you interested in grout sealing?"
Use: "I'm including grout sealing in your quote because it extends results by
1-2 years. We'll apply it right after cleaning."

Instead of: "Do you want to move forward?"
Use: "I have availability next Tuesday or Thursday. Which works better for your
schedule?"

UPSELLING TECHNIQUES:

Natural Upsell Opportunities:

During Quoting:
• "While we're there for the kitchen tile, we could also clean the bathroom
  tile at a bundled rate - save you 15% total."
• "If you have carpets too, bundling tile and carpet cleaning saves 10-15% on
  both services."

During Service:
• Technician notices: "I see you have upholstered dining chairs - we can
  protect those from spills while we're here."
• "Your carpet could use refreshing too - we're already here with the truck."

Sealing Upsell:
• "I see you're not planning to seal. Just so you know, without sealing, your
  grout will re-soil about twice as fast - you'll need professional cleaning
  again in 6-12 months instead of 2-3 years. Sealing costs an extra $45-75
  now but saves you $150-200 in premature cleaning. Most customers choose to
  seal for that reason."

HANDLING COMPETITOR COMPARISONS:

If customer mentions competitor quotes:
• Don't badmouth competitors directly
• Ask clarifying questions: "What exactly is included in that quote? Square
  footage? Grout sealing? Do they guarantee their work?"
• Differentiate on value, not just price
• Highlight Chem-Dry's national reputation, 40+ years experience, guarantee

Example:
"I appreciate you getting multiple quotes - that's smart shopping. A few
questions to make sure you're comparing apples to apples: Does their quote
include grout sealing or just cleaning? What equipment do they use - is it
truck-mounted or portable? Do they offer any guarantee? How long have they been
in business?

What I can tell you is Chem-Dry has been perfecting our process for over 40
years. We use proprietary cleaning solutions that leave no dirt-attracting
residue, professional equipment, certified technicians, and we back everything
with a satisfaction guarantee. If another company offers all of that at a lower
price, they're either taking a loss to get in your door or cutting corners
somewhere. We price fairly for professional-grade service that delivers lasting
results."

REFERRAL GENERATION:

Best time to ask: Right after service when customer is delighted with results.

Script:
"I'm so glad you're happy with how your floors turned out! We grow our business
primarily through referrals from satisfied customers like you. If you know
anyone who could benefit from tile and grout cleaning - neighbors, family,
friends, coworkers - we'd love to take great care of them too. For every
referral that books service, we'll give you [referral incentive: $25 credit /
10% off next service / etc.]. Do you know anyone who might need their tile
cleaned?"

Make it easy:
• Provide referral cards
• Send follow-up email with shareable link
• Offer incentive for both referrer and referee
• Follow up: "Did [referred name] get scheduled? Let me know if I can help."

SEASONAL OPPORTUNITIES:

Spring (March-May):
• "Spring cleaning" promotions
• "Refresh your home for summer entertaining"
• Mother's Day specials
• New homeowner move-in cleaning

Summer (June-August):
• Pre-vacation cleaning

• Prepare for back-to-school routines

• Thanksgiving preparation
• Back-to-school cleaning
• Transition from summer to indoor season

Winter (December-February):
• Holiday preparation

• Cold weather indoor project timing

CLOSING RATIO IMPROVEMENT:

Track and measure:
• Lead source (which marketing generates best leads?)
• Conversion rate (what % of quotes become bookings?)
• Average ticket (are you maximizing each job value?)
• Upsell success (what % add sealing or other services?)

Continuous improvement:
• Record calls and review for improvement opportunities
• Practice objection handling responses
• Update pricing based on market and costs
• A/B test different promotions and messaging
• Gather and showcase customer testimonials

================================================================================
10. QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF QUALIFICATION:
These questions help determine if the customer is a good fit for service, allow
accurate quoting, and uncover upselling opportunities.

MUST-ASK QUESTIONS:

1. LOCATION & SERVICE AREA:
   "What's your address? Just want to confirm you're in our service area."

   Purpose: Ensure they're within service radius, check travel time costs

2. TILE TYPE:
   "What type of tile do you have - ceramic, porcelain, or natural stone like
   marble or travertine?"

   Purpose: Determines appropriate cleaning solutions and pricing (stone =
   premium)

3. AREAS TO BE CLEANED:
   "Which rooms or areas are you looking to have cleaned?"

   Purpose: Calculate square footage, identify multiple rooms for bundling

4. SQUARE FOOTAGE:
   "Do you happen to know approximately how many square feet of tile you have?
   If not, we can measure on-site."

   Purpose: Provide accurate quote, though on-site measurement is typical

5. SOIL LEVEL:
   "How would you describe the current condition - lightly soiled, moderately
   dirty, or heavily stained and discolored?"

   Purpose: Sets expectations, adjusts pricing, determines service duration

6. LAST PROFESSIONAL CLEANING:
   "When was the last time you had professional tile and grout cleaning?"

   Options: Never / 1-2 years ago / 3-5 years ago / 5+ years ago

   Purpose: Indicates likely soil level, sets expectations for results

7. GROUT SEALING STATUS:
   "Is your grout currently sealed, or has it ever been sealed?"

   Purpose: Upsell opportunity, sets expectations for maintenance needs

8. SPECIFIC CONCERNS:
   "Are there any specific problem areas or stains you're most concerned about?"

   Purpose: Manage expectations, identify potential limitations

9. VERTICAL SURFACES:
   "Do you also want shower walls, tub surrounds, or backsplashes cleaned, or
   just floors?"

   Purpose: Additional square footage, premium pricing for vertical

10. TIMELINE:
    "What's your timeframe for getting this done? Is this urgent, or are you
    planning ahead?"

    Purpose: Prioritize scheduling, identify event-driven sales opportunities

NICE-TO-KNOW QUESTIONS:

11. PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES:
    "Have you had tile and grout cleaning before? How was that experience?"

    Purpose: Overcome previous bad experiences, differentiate Chem-Dry

12. OTHER FLOORING:
    "Do you also have carpets or upholstered furniture that could use cleaning?"

    Purpose: Upsell opportunity, bundle pricing

13. HOME OWNERSHIP:
    "Are you the homeowner, or are you renting?"

    Purpose: Decision-making authority, potential for landlord/property manager
    accounts

14. DISCOVERY METHOD:
    "How did you hear about Chem-Dry?"

    Purpose: Track marketing effectiveness, adjust spending

15. DECISION TIMELINE:
    "Are you getting quotes from other companies, or are you ready to schedule?"

    Purpose: Assess urgency, competition level

QUALIFICATION SCORING:

HIGH-VALUE LEAD (prioritize):
• Multiple rooms/large square footage
• Natural stone (premium pricing)
• Interested in sealing + cleaning
• Ready to book immediately
• Event-driven urgency (holiday, home sale, party)
• Heard about Chem-Dry through referral

MEDIUM-VALUE LEAD:
• Single room or moderate square footage
• Ceramic/porcelain tile
• Shopping around / getting multiple quotes
• Flexible timeline
• Found via online search

LOWER-VALUE LEAD (still service, but less priority):
• Very small area (under 50 sq ft)
• Only wants pricing, not ready to book
• Extreme price sensitivity
• Unrealistic expectations ("make 20-year-old grout look new")
• Outside service area (long travel time)

RED FLAGS (may not be good fit):
• Expects guaranteed stain removal without inspection
• Wants service immediately (same-day) without emergency context
• Hostile or rude communication
• History of disputing charges or never satisfied
• Asks for cash-only pricing (tax avoidance)

================================================================================
11. COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES & UPSELLING
================================================================================

NATURAL SERVICE COMBINATIONS:

Tile + Carpet Cleaning:
• Most homes have both flooring types
• Cleaning both in same visit = convenience
• Bundle discount: 10-15% off total
• Efficiency: Truck already on-site

Script: "While we're cleaning your kitchen tile, I notice you have carpets in
the living and dining rooms. We can clean those at the same time and save you
10% on the whole package. That way, your entire main floor gets refreshed in
one visit."

Tile + Upholstery Cleaning:
• Kitchen/dining areas often have upholstered chairs
• Protect furniture from food/drink spills
• Bundle discount: 15% off combined services
• Visual appeal: Clean floors + clean furniture

Script: "Your tile floors are going to look amazing. I also notice your dining
chairs - we can clean and protect those too. A lot of customers like having
both done together so the whole space feels fresh. We offer 15% off when you
bundle upholstery with tile cleaning."

Tile + Area Rug Cleaning:
• Many homes have area rugs on tile floors
• Rugs need professional cleaning too
• Convenient: Pick up rugs during tile service
• Bundle opportunity

Script: "I see you have area rugs on your tile floors. We offer professional
rug cleaning - we can pick them up today while we're here, clean them at our
facility, and return them once your tile is clean and sealed. Most customers
love having everything fresh at once."

GROUT SEALING UPSELL (MOST IMPORTANT):

Why It Matters:
• Grout sealing is highly profitable add-on
• Provides significant value to customer
• Easy to upsell during quoting or service
• Low time investment, high ROI

Upsell Triggers:
• Customer mentions grout getting dirty quickly
• Grout hasn't been sealed before or seal has worn off
• Customer wants results to last as long as possible
• High-traffic areas (kitchen, entryway)
• Light-colored grout (shows stains easily)

Upsell Script - During Quoting:
"I'm including grout sealing in this quote. Here's why: Unsealed grout acts
like a sponge - it absorbs spills, dirt, and moisture, which is why it gets
dirty so fast. Sealing creates a protective barrier that repels stains and
moisture. It adds about $45-75 to your service but extends the life of this
cleaning by 1-2 years. Without sealing, you'd need professional cleaning again
in 6-12 months. With sealing, you can go 2-3 years. It's a small investment
that saves you money long-term. Does that make sense?"

Upsell Script - During Service:
"I'm looking at your grout and can see it's not sealed. That's why it's gotten
so dirty - it's absorbing everything. I can seal it for you today while we're
here for an additional $60. That'll protect it and keep it looking clean for
2-3 years instead of needing cleaning again next year. Most customers choose to
seal for that reason - want me to add it?"

COLOR SEALING UPSELL:

When to Offer:
• Grout has permanent staining that cleaning can't remove
• Customer wants a uniform grout color
• Old grout with inconsistent coloring
• Customer wants "like new" appearance

Value Proposition:
• Changes grout color while protecting
• Covers permanent stains
• Uniform appearance throughout
• Maximum protection from future stains

Script:
"I can see your grout has some permanent staining that even professional
cleaning may not fully remove. We offer color sealing as an option - this
applies a pigmented sealer that changes your grout color to your choice (usually
a neutral gray or tan), covers all existing stains, and provides maximum
protection. It costs more than standard sealing ($0.75-1.50 per sq ft vs.
$0.15-0.30), but gives you that 'like new' look and the longest-lasting
protection. Would you like to see color options?"

CROSS-SELLING OTHER CHEM-DRY SERVICES:

Commercial Cleaning:
• If customer owns business with tile floors
• Recurring revenue opportunity
• Different decision-making process (ROI-focused)

Script: "Do you own a business or commercial property? We also provide tile and
grout cleaning for commercial facilities - restaurants, retail stores, offices,
medical facilities. We can set up a recurring maintenance schedule to keep your
business looking professional."

P.U.R.T. (Pet Urine Removal Treatment):
• If customer has pets and mentions odors
• Works on tile subfloors before new flooring
• Addresses urine penetration into grout

Script: "I notice you have pets. If you've ever had any accidents on these
floors, urine can penetrate deep into grout and the subfloor underneath,
causing odors. We offer a specialized treatment called P.U.R.T. that eliminates
urine odor at the molecular level. Would that be helpful for your situation?"

Specialty Stain Removal:
• For specific stubborn stains on tile or grout
• Wine, rust, paint, etc.
• Requires specialized chemicals and techniques

Script: "I see you have some [wine/rust/paint] stains. Those require specialized
treatment beyond standard cleaning. We offer specialty stain removal services
for tough stains like these. I can give you a quote for addressing those
specifically."

PACKAGE BUILDING STRATEGY:

Bronze Package: Cleaning Only

• Pre-scheduled cleaning every 12-24 months
• Locked-in pricing (protects against future increases)
• Priority scheduling
• Free grout re-sealing after every other cleaning
• 10% discount on all additional services

Script:
"Many of our customers sign up for our maintenance program. You pre-pay for
annual or bi-annual cleaning at today's locked-in price, which protects you
from future rate increases. You get priority scheduling, automatic reminders,
and we include free grout re-sealing after every other cleaning. Plus 10% off
any additional services year-round. It's basically a 'set it and forget it'
approach to maintaining your floors. Interested in hearing more?"

REFERRAL PROGRAM:

Incentivize Word-of-Mouth:
• $25 credit for each referred customer who books
• Or 10% off next service for each referral
• No limit on number of referrals

Script:
"One more thing - we love referrals! If you know anyone who could use tile and
grout cleaning, we'll give you a $25 credit for each person you refer who books
service. There's no limit - some customers rack up hundreds in credits. I'll
send you some referral cards and a shareable link you can text or email to
friends."

FINANCING AS UPSELL ENABLER:

Remove Price Barrier:
• Customers more likely to add services if payment is spread out
• $400 package becomes $40/month for 12 months
• Emphasize affordable monthly payment, not total price

Script:
"I know the Platinum package is an investment, but with our financing options,
it breaks down to just $40 per month for 12 months - about the cost of two
dinners out. For that, you get your entire home's flooring professionally
cleaned and protected. We can get you approved in minutes if you'd like to
apply."

• Provide value (cleaning tips, maintenance advice)
• Remember personal details (pet names, upcoming events mentioned)
• Celebrate milestones (anniversary of first service, holidays)
• Reward loyalty (discounts for repeat customers)
• Make rebooking frictionless (one-click scheduling links)

Example - Holiday Card:
"Happy Holidays from all of us at Chem-Dry! We appreciate your business this
year and hope you're enjoying your beautifully maintained tile floors. As a
thank-you, here's a 15%-off coupon for any service booked in January. Wishing
you a wonderful new year!"

CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE:

Calculate and Maximize:
• Average customer gets tile cleaned every 1-2 years = $150-200 per service
• Average customer lifespan: 10-15 years in same home
• Potential lifetime value: $1,500-3,000 from tile cleaning alone
• Add carpets, upholstery, specialty services: $5,000-10,000 lifetime value

Implication:
Invest in customer satisfaction and retention. The cost of re-servicing a
dissatisfied customer ($50-100) is negligible compared to the lifetime value of
a happy, repeat customer ($5,000-10,000). Always prioritize long-term
relationship over short-term profit.

  surrounds

• Dry time: 1-2 hours for cleaning only, 24-48 hours after sealing

Key Benefits:
• Restores grout to original color
• Removes embedded dirt, bacteria, mold, and mildew
• Extends life of tile and grout (delays/eliminates regrouting)
• Healthier, more hygienic floors
• Optional sealing prevents future staining

Pricing:
• Square footage-based: $0.30-0.75 per sq ft for cleaning

Common Questions:
• "How long does it take?" → 1-3 hours depending on size
• "How long to dry?" → 1-2 hours for cleaning, 24-48 hours after sealing
• "How often needed?" → Every 1-2 years for most homes
• "Can you remove all stains?" → Most stains, yes; deeply set permanent stains
  may need color sealing
• "Natural stone?" → Yes, with specialized solutions (+10-25% premium pricing)

Top Objections:
• "Too expensive" → Compare to regrouting ($5-15/sq ft) or replacement ($15-30/
  sq ft)
• "Can do it myself" → Rental equipment 1/4 the power, inferior results, no
  guarantee
• "Don't need sealing" → Unsealed grout re-soils 2x faster, needs cleaning
  sooner

Brand Guidelines:
• Always: "Chem-Dry's tile cleaning" or "tile cleaning from Chem-Dry"

• Type of tile (ceramic/porcelain = standard, stone = premium)
• Square footage (size determines pricing)
