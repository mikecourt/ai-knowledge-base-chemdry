1. SERVICE OVERVIEW
===========================================

WHAT IS UPHOLSTERY CLEANING FROM CHEM-DRY?

Chem-Dry's upholstery cleaning service delivers professional-grade furniture cleaning using our proprietary Hot Carbonating Extraction (HCE) process. We restore the beauty, freshness, and comfort of sofas, chairs, loveseats, sectionals, ottomans, and other upholstered furniture pieces.

Our service goes beyond surface cleaning to remove embedded dirt, allergens, bacteria, and odors while using approximately 80% less water than traditional steam cleaning methods. The result is furniture that looks better, feels fresher, and dries faster—typically in 1-2 hours instead of 1-2 days.

WHAT MAKES CHEM-DRY UPHOLSTERY CLEANING DIFFERENT:

• Hot Carbonating Extraction Technology: Millions of tiny bubbles lift dirt and grime to the surface where it can be extracted
• Low-Moisture Process: Approximately 80% less water than steam cleaning
• Fast Drying: 1-2 hours vs. 12-24 hours with steam cleaning
• Green Certified Solutions: The Natural® is FDA-certified safe and non-toxic
• No Dirt-Attracting Residue: Furniture stays clean longer
• Comprehensive Protection: Optional Healthy Home® protectant applications
• 98% Allergen Removal: Creates healthier indoor environment
• 89% Bacteria Reduction: Effective against common household bacteria

FURNITURE WE CLEAN:

• Sofas and Sectionals (full-size couches, modular sectionals, sleeper sofas)
• Chairs and Recliners (accent chairs, armchairs, recliners, office chairs)
• Loveseats and Settees (two-seater sofas, benches with upholstery)
• Ottomans and Footstools (storage ottomans, footrests, poufs)
• Dining Chairs (upholstered seats and backs)
• Specialty Furniture (chaise lounges, window seats, upholstered headboards)

BENEFITS TO HOMEOWNERS:

• Healthier Indoor Environment: Removes up to 98% of allergens and 89% of bacteria
• Extended Furniture Life: Regular cleaning removes abrasive dirt that causes wear
• Superior Results: Carbonation cleans deeper than DIY or steam cleaning
• Fast Dry Times: Furniture dry in 1-2 hours, rooms return to normal use quickly
• No Toxic Residues: Safe for children and pets, no harsh chemical residues
• Stain and Odor Removal: Treats common stains and eliminates odors at source

===========================================
2. HOT CARBONATING EXTRACTION (HCE) FOR UPHOLSTERY
===========================================

THE CARBONATION EFFECT:

Our process begins with The Natural®, a carbonating cleaning solution containing millions of microscopic carbonating bubbles:

1. Bubble Action: Carbonating bubbles penetrate deep into fabric fibers
2. Explosion Effect: Bubbles explode dirt and grime from base of fiber upward to surface
3. Lifting Mechanism: Unlike steam cleaning that pushes water deeper, carbonation lifts contaminants to surface
4. Physical vs Chemical: Mechanical action of carbonation does most cleaning work, reducing need for harsh chemicals

LOW-MOISTURE ADVANTAGES:

Traditional steam cleaning saturates upholstery with gallons of water. Chem-Dry's low-moisture process uses approximately 80% less water:

• Rapid Drying: 1-2 hours instead of 1-2 days (no saturating cushions/padding)
• Mold Prevention: Eliminates mold and mildew growth risk from excessive moisture
• No Watermarks: Prevents water-soluble dyes from bleeding or running
• Structural Integrity: Protects wooden frames, springs, and foam padding from water damage
• No Musty Odors: Quick drying prevents dampness that causes mildew smells

THE NATURAL® CLEANING SOLUTION:

• Contains No Soaps or Detergents: No sticky residues that attract dirt
• Green Certified: FDA-certified safe and non-toxic
• Leaves No Residue: Furniture stays cleaner longer
• pH Balanced: Gentle on all fabric types, safe for color-fast materials
• Natural Ingredients: Made from renewable resources, safe for children and pets

ALLERGEN AND BACTERIA REMOVAL:

Independent laboratory testing demonstrates:
• 98% Allergen Removal: Dust mites, pollen, pet dander, mold spores
• 89% Bacteria Reduction: Common household bacteria eliminated
• Dust Mite Elimination: Deep cleaning + rapid drying creates inhospitable environment

ADDRESSING "TOO EXPENSIVE" OBJECTIONS:

Script:
"I understand it's an investment. Let me ask—how long have you had this furniture? [Listen] And how much did you invest originally? [Listen] So you've invested $[amount] in furniture you use every day. Our service costs [price], which is less than 10% of your original investment but can extend your furniture's life by years. Plus, you'll remove allergens affecting your family's health daily. When you break it down, that's less than a dollar per day over the next year to protect your investment and your family's wellbeing."

===========================================
7. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
===========================================

ABOUT THE PROCESS:

Q: How is upholstery cleaning different from carpet cleaning?
A: While both use Hot Carbonating Extraction technology, upholstery cleaning requires specialized training and equipment adapted for furniture. Upholstered furniture has different fabrics, construction methods, and cleaning codes than carpet. We use specialized tools designed for furniture contours, seams, and delicate fabrics.

Q: How long does upholstery cleaning take?
A: For a typical three-piece set (sofa, loveseat, chair), service usually takes 45-90 minutes. A single sofa typically takes 20-30 minutes. Exact time depends on size, soil level, and whether adding protectant or specialty treatments.

Q: How long until my furniture is dry?
A: Most upholstered furniture dries in 1-2 hours, thanks to our low-moisture process. We use approximately 80% less water than steam cleaning, which would leave furniture wet for 12-24 hours. Drying varies by fabric type, humidity, and ventilation.

Q: Is your cleaning safe for all types of upholstery?
A: We can clean most "W" (water-safe) and "WS" (water or solvent) coded fabrics. Before starting, our technician checks the cleaning code tag on your furniture (under cushions or on bottom). We cannot clean "S" (solvent only) or "X" (vacuum only) fabrics. We assess condition and inform you of any concerns before proceeding.

Q: Will cleaning remove pet hair?
A: We remove loose pet hair during pre-vacuuming, but our process focuses on soil, stains, and odors. For best results, vacuum furniture thoroughly before our arrival, or add our pre-vacuuming service for additional fee. For deeply embedded hair, consider lint roller as ongoing maintenance.

Q: Can you remove all stains from my furniture?
A: Not all stains can be completely removed. Some stains, especially old ones or those treated incorrectly at home, may have permanently bonded with fabric fibers. However, we have excellent success with most common stains (food, beverages, body oils). We assess each stain and provide realistic expectations. Specialty stain treatments available for tough stains.

Q: What about pet odors in furniture?
A: For pet odors, we have specialized P.U.R.T.® (Pet Urine Removal Treatment) that uses enzyme action to destroy urine crystals at molecular level. Standard cleaning helps surface odors, but P.U.R.T.® is needed for urine soaked into cushions or padding. This permanently eliminates odors rather than masking them.

ABOUT RESULTS:

Q: How often should I have upholstery professionally cleaned?
A: We recommend every 12-24 months for most households. Clean more frequently if you:
• Have young children or pets (every 6-12 months)
• Suffer from allergies or asthma (every 6-12 months)
• Have light-colored furniture in high-use areas (every 9-12 months)
• Entertain frequently (every 12-18 months)

Q: Will cleaning bring back "like new" appearance?
A: Professional cleaning dramatically improves appearance by removing soil, brightening colors, and restoring texture. However, we set realistic expectations: if fabric is worn, faded from sun, or damaged, cleaning won't reverse that. Cleaning removes dirt making wear look worse. Many customers are amazed—they thought furniture was worn when it was just dirty.

Q: Will furniture stay clean longer than with DIY methods?
A: Absolutely! Because we don't use soaps or detergents, there's no dirt-attracting residue left behind. DIY machines and rental equipment use soap-based solutions leaving residue, causing furniture to get dirty again quickly (sometimes within weeks). Customers consistently report furniture stays clean 50-100% longer.

ABOUT HEALTH & SAFETY:

Q: Is the cleaning solution safe for my family and pets?
A: Yes! The Natural®, our core cleaner, is Green Certified by the FDA. It doesn't rely on harsh chemicals—instead uses power of carbonation to lift dirt. Many customers choose us specifically for young children or pets wanting effective but safe cleaning. Kids and pets can be back on furniture as soon as dry (typically 1-2 hours).

Q: Will upholstery cleaning help with allergies?
A: Definitely! Upholstered furniture traps dust mites, pollen, pet dander, and allergens triggering allergy and asthma symptoms. Our HCE process removes 98% of common allergens from upholstery. Many customers notice significant improvement in allergy symptoms. For allergy sufferers, recommend cleaning both carpets and upholstery every 6 months.

Q: Is there risk of mold or mildew growth?
A: No! Because we use approximately 80% less water and furniture dries in 1-2 hours, there isn't enough moisture or time for mold/mildew to develop. Traditional steam cleaning leaves furniture damp for 12-24 hours, creating perfect conditions for mold growth—especially with thick cushions or in humid climates.

ABOUT PRICING & VALUE:

Q: Why does Chem-Dry cost more than some other cleaners?
A: While our price may be higher initially, most customers find we're more cost-effective long-term:
1. Furniture stays clean much longer (no residue), so you clean less frequently
2. Process is gentler, extending furniture lifespan
3. Faster drying means less household disruption
4. Healthier results with 98% allergen removal
5. Green Certified, family-safe process
6. Satisfaction guarantee
When factoring longer-lasting results and better value, we're competitively priced for quality received.

Q: Do you offer package deals?
A: Yes! Multiple ways to save:
• Multi-piece discounts (typically 10-15% off third piece and beyond)
• Combination packages (upholstery and carpets together)
• Seasonal promotions throughout year
• Loyalty discounts for returning customers
Ask about current specials and package options when booking!

Q: What if I'm not satisfied with results?
A: We offer 100% satisfaction guarantee. If not completely satisfied, we'll return to re-clean areas of concern at no charge. If still not satisfied after that, we'll refund your money. We stand behind our work because we believe in our process and team.

===========================================
8. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS
===========================================

PRICE OBJECTIONS:

Objection: "That's too expensive. I can rent a machine and do it myself."

Script:
"I completely understand wanting to save money! Before you rent a machine, let me share what many customers learned:

Rental machines for upholstery:
• Cost $30-50 plus cleaning solution ($15-25)
• Are designed for carpets, not furniture
• Use soap leaving sticky residue attracting dirt back
• Over-wet furniture, leading to 12-24 hour drying and mold risk
• Can damage delicate fabrics
• Results often last just a few weeks

With our professional service:
• Tools specifically designed for upholstery
• Dry in 1-2 hours with low-moisture process
• No dirt-attracting residue, results last 6-12 months
• Safe for fabrics with Green Certified solutions
• Guaranteed satisfaction

When you add up rental cost ($45-75), plus your time (3-4 hours hard work), you're close to our professional price. Many customers tried rental first and wish they'd just called us—they ended up paying for both! Would you rather invest your Saturday doing hard labor for mediocre results, or let us handle it professionally while you relax?"

---

Objection: "That's more expensive than the quote I got from [competitor]."

Script:
"I'm glad you're comparing options—that's smart! Before deciding on price alone, I'd encourage comparing what you're getting:

Questions to ask your other quote:
1. What process do they use? (Most use steam cleaning, leaving furniture wet 12-24 hours)
2. What solutions do they use? (Are they Green Certified and safe?)
3. How much water do they use? (Steam cleaning can damage cushions and create mold)
4. What's their guarantee? (Will they return if not satisfied?)
5. How long in business? (Fly-by-night companies are common)

What makes Chem-Dry different:
• Hot Carbonating Extraction—proprietary technology we own
• 1-2 hour drying vs. 12-24 hours
• Green Certified, FDA-approved solutions
• 98% allergen removal (independently tested)
• Over 45 years in business, world's largest carpet/upholstery cleaning franchise
• 100% satisfaction guarantee

You might find lower price, but will you get these results? Most customers tried cheaper services first and ended up calling us anyway. They wish they'd come to us from start. What's most important to you—lowest price or best results for your furniture and family?"

TIMING OBJECTIONS:

Objection: "I'm not ready to schedule right now."

Script:
"No problem! I completely understand. What would be a better time? Are you waiting for something specific, or is there something else you need to figure out first?"

[Listen to their reason]

If budget-related:
"I understand budget constraints. Let me share a couple options:
1. We offer financing making this about $[X] per month
2. We could start with most-used pieces now, schedule rest later
3. I can check for upcoming promotions that might help
Which of these might work for you?"

If schedule-related:
"That makes sense. Here's what I'd suggest: Let me get you on calendar for [future date]. We'll send reminder, and if something changes, you can always reschedule. The benefit is you get your preferred date/time before we fill up. We're especially busy during [busy season], so booking ahead is smart. What day of week typically works best?"

If decision-related:
"That's fine—this is an investment and I want you to feel good about it. To help you think it through, what specific questions or concerns do you still have? [Address concerns] Based on what you've told me about [their situation], here's why I think this would be good decision for you... [tailor to needs]"

QUALITY/TRUST OBJECTIONS:

Objection: "How do I know you'll do a good job?"

Script:
"That's a smart question! You should absolutely vet anyone you let into your home and trust with your furniture. Let me tell you why you can feel confident:

Our Track Record:
• Chem-Dry has been in business over 45 years
• World's largest carpet and upholstery cleaning franchise

===========================================
10. SALES BEST PRACTICES
===========================================

CONSULTATIVE APPROACH:

Shift from "selling" to "helping":

Traditional Sales:
• Tell customer about upholstery cleaning
• List features and benefits
• Overcome objections
• Push for close
• Transaction-focused

Consultative Approach:
• Ask about their furniture concerns
• Identify specific problems
• Educate about solutions
• Guide decision-making
• Relationship-focused

Example:
❌ Transactional: "We clean upholstery with Hot Carbonating Extraction. It's better than steam cleaning. When can we schedule you?"

✅ Consultative: "Tell me about your furniture—what concerns do you have? [Listen] I understand. Based on what you've told me about [their specific issue], here's how our process specifically addresses that... [Explain relevantly] Does that sound like it would solve your problem?"

ACTIVE LISTENING:

Do:
• Let customer finish describing furniture concerns
• Ask clarifying questions about stains, odors, appearance
• Acknowledge their concerns
• Take notes on specific problem areas
• Reflect back what you heard

Don't:
• Interrupt their story
• Dismiss concerns about fabric damage
• Jump to solutions before understanding problem
• Assume all upholstery cleaning needs are same

Reflective Listening:
"So if I understand correctly, your main concern is [summarize issue] on your [furniture piece], and you're worried about [specific concern]. Is that right?"

FURNITURE ASSESSMENT SKILLS:

Check Cleaning Codes:
• Always look for cleaning code tag
• Usually under cushions or on furniture bottom
• W = Water safe (you can clean)
• S = Solvent only (cannot clean)
• WS = Water or solvent (you can clean)
• X = Vacuum only (cannot clean)

Assess Fabric Condition:
• Look for wear patterns and damage
• Check for color fading or sun damage
• Identify tears or structural issues
• Assess soil level and stain severity
• Set realistic expectations based on condition

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS:

Be Honest About:
• What stains may not come out completely
• Wear vs. dirt (cleaning reveals wear)
• Color fading that won't be restored
• Structural damage beyond cleaning scope
• Drying time variations by fabric type

Under-Promise and Over-Deliver:
• Set conservative expectations for tough stains
• Explain "significantly improved" vs. "completely removed"
• Prepare for possibility stains may lighten but not disappear
• When results exceed expectations, customer is thrilled

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

• Overpromising Results: Never guarantee complete stain removal
• Ignoring Cleaning Codes: Always check the tag, never proceed with "S" or "X" fabrics
• Skipping Inspection: Always do thorough pre-service inspection and document damage
• Talking Too Much: Listen more than you speak
• Being Pushy: Consultative approach, not aggressive

===========================================
11. QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS
===========================================

FURNITURE INVENTORY:

"What pieces of furniture are you looking to have cleaned?"
• Purpose: Understand scope and calculate pricing
• Follow-ups: How many seats? Sectional configuration? Matching pieces? Ottomans? Dining chairs?

"How old is your furniture?"
• Purpose: Gauge condition and value
• Listen for: Brand new (recommend protectant), few years (standard maintenance), very old (set expectations)

"What color is your upholstery?"
• Purpose: Understand stain visibility
• Light colors = stains show easily (strong protectant candidate)
• Dark colors = may not see dirt but it's still there
• Patterns = can hide some staining

HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION:

"Do you have children, pets, or both?"
• If children: Emphasize safety, allergen removal, quick drying, recommend protectant
• If pets: Ask about accidents/odors, position P.U.R.T.®, emphasize allergen removal
• If both: Strong emphasis on health/safety, quick drying critical, protectant valuable

"Does anyone in household have allergies or asthma?"
• If yes: Lead with 98% allergen removal, recommend 6-month schedule, suggest cleaning carpet and upholstery

PROBLEM ASSESSMENT:

"What prompted you to look into upholstery cleaning today?"
• Listen for: Specific event (create urgency), problem (address pain), routine maintenance, external pressure

"Do you have any specific stains or problem areas?"
• Listen for: Type of stains, location/size, age, previous treatment attempts
• Use to set expectations, recommend specialty treatment, position P.U.R.T.®

"Have you noticed any odors coming from your furniture?"
• If yes: What kind? How long? Tried anything?
• Use to position appropriate odor treatment, create urgency

EXPERIENCE & EXPECTATIONS:

"When was the last time you had upholstery professionally cleaned?"
• Never = likely heavily soiled, emphasize dramatic results
• Recently = may have complaint about previous service
• Years ago = overdue, discuss health and appearance benefits

"What are you hoping to achieve with professional cleaning?"
• Common answers: Remove stains, freshen appearance, remove allergens, eliminate odors, extend furniture life
• Tailor pitch to their stated priority

DECISION-MAKING:

"Who else is involved in this decision?"
• Identify all decision-makers
• Ensure you address both parties' concerns

"Have you gotten other quotes, or are we your first call?"
• First call = you're setting expectations, educate thoroughly
• Have other quotes = differentiate on value and process

"When were you hoping to have this done?"
• Gauge urgency and timeline
• Create urgency, show limited availability

===========================================
12. COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES & UPSELLING
===========================================

CARPET CLEANING:

When to Recommend:
• Customer has carpeted rooms near upholstered furniture
• Visible traffic patterns or staining on carpet
• Logic: "Since the furniture sits on the carpet..."

Positioning:
"While we're cleaning your upholstery, it makes perfect sense to clean your carpets too. Think about it—all the soil, allergens, and dirt accumulating in your furniture also accumulate in your carpet. If we clean one but not the other, you're only getting half the benefit.

Plus, when we do them together, you get:
• Package discount (typically save $25-50)
• Everything fresh and clean at once
• Only one appointment to schedule
• Entire room looks and smells fresh
• Maximize allergen removal throughout space

Most customers find it makes sense to do both. How much carpet are we talking about in your main living areas?"

PROTECTANT APPLICATION:

When to Recommend:
• Newer or recently cleaned furniture
• Light-colored upholstery
• Homes with children or pets
• High-traffic furniture pieces
• After successful stain removal

Positioning:
"Now that your furniture is beautifully clean, I strongly recommend our fabric protectant. It creates an invisible barrier that helps liquids bead up on the surface instead of soaking in. This gives you time to blot up spills before they become stains.

It's especially valuable for:
• Light-colored furniture like yours
• Families with kids who might spill drinks or snacks
• Pet owners dealing with accidents
• High-use furniture in main living areas

The protectant typically costs about 30-40% of the cleaning price, so for your [furniture], it would be $[X]. Most customers find it's absolutely worth it—especially when they see how much easier cleanup is the first time someone spills something! Should we add that today?"

P.U.R.T.® (PET URINE REMOVAL TREATMENT):

When to Recommend:
• Customer mentions pet accidents
• Visible urine staining on furniture
• Pet odors detected during inspection
• Customer asks about odor removal

Positioning:
"I can see you're dealing with pet accidents on your furniture. Standard cleaning will help, but for complete odor elimination, we have a revolutionary treatment called P.U.R.T.® It uses enzyme action to actually destroy urine odor crystals at the molecular level—it doesn't just mask the smell like deodorizers do.

Here's the difference:
• Surface cleaning removes visible staining but odor molecules remain in cushions
• P.U.R.T.® penetrates cushions and padding to eliminate odor at source
• Results are permanent—the odor won't come back
• Safe for pets and family

For the affected areas on your [furniture], P.U.R.T.® would be $[X]. Given how much the odor bothers you and the fact that it will only get worse over time, most customers find it's worth every penny for the peace of mind. Should we include that with today's cleaning?"

SPECIALTY STAIN TREATMENT:

When to Recommend:
• Customer points out specific problem stains
• Ink, wine, coffee, or other challenging stains visible
• Old or set-in stains needing extra attention

OTHER COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES:

• Area Rug Cleaning (in-home or in-plant)
• Tile and Grout Cleaning (adjacent to living areas)
