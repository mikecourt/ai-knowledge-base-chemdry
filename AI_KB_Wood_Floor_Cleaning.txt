================================================================================
2. THE SCIENCE BEHIND WOOD FLOOR CLEANING
================================================================================

WHY WOOD FLOORS NEED PROFESSIONAL CARE:

Hardwood floors are an investment worth protecting:

Buildup Over Time:
• Dirt, dust, and grit act like sandpaper, dulling finish
• Cleaning product residue accumulates and creates dullness
• Body oils, cooking oils, and other substances build up
• Traffic patterns become visible as finish wears unevenly

The Mopping Problem:
• Excessive water can seep between boards causing warping
• Too much moisture damages wood and finish
• Improper cleaners leave residue or damage finish
• Mops spread dirt rather than removing it

The Chem-Dry Solution:
Our process uses specialized wood floor cleaning solutions applied with minimal
moisture, then gently agitated and removed, taking dirt and buildup with it
while leaving floors clean, protected, and beautiful.

HOW THE PROCESS WORKS:

Step 1: Dry Soil Removal
Thorough vacuuming removes loose dirt, dust, and debris that can scratch during
cleaning.

Step 2: Specialized Cleaning Solution
Wood-safe, pH-balanced solution is applied sparingly to break down soil and
buildup.

Step 3: Gentle Agitation
Soft pads or cloths work the solution to lift dirt without damaging finish.

Step 4: Removal
Solution and dissolved soil are removed, leaving floors clean and nearly dry.

Step 5: Optional Finish Enhancement
For added protection and shine, a finish renewal treatment can be applied.

WHY PROFESSIONAL CLEANING PROTECTS YOUR INVESTMENT:

Investment Protection:
• Hardwood installation costs $6-12 per square foot
• 1,500 sq ft home = $9,000-18,000 investment
• Refinishing costs $3-5 per square foot = $4,500-7,500
• Professional cleaning extends refinishing cycle by 5-10 years

Without Professional Cleaning:
• Refinish every 7-10 years
• Cost: $5,000-7,000 per refinishing
• Over 30 years: 3-4 refinishings = $15,000-28,000
• Major disruptions every 7-10 years

With Professional Cleaning (annually):
• Refinish every 15-20 years
• Floors look better continuously (not just post-refinish)
• No major disruptions every 7-10 years
• Preserves original wood (refinishing removes wood layer)
• Home value maintained better
• Quality of life improvement

7. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

ABOUT THE PROCESS:

Q: How is your wood floor cleaning different from mopping?
A: Great question! Traditional mopping actually has several problems: it spreads
dirty water around rather than removing soil, leaves residue that dulls your
floors, uses too much water that can seep between boards, and the results only
last a few days.

Our professional cleaning uses minimal moisture with wood-safe, pH-balanced
solutions specifically designed for hardwood floors. We actually remove soil and
buildup rather than spreading it around. Your floors dry in 30-60 minutes
instead of staying wet for hours, there's no dulling residue, and results last
12-18 months. Plus, we do all the work!

Q: Will this damage my hardwood floors?
A: Absolutely not - in fact, we protect them! Before we start, we verify your
floor finish type to ensure compatibility. Our process uses minimal moisture
(floors dry in 30-60 minutes), pH-balanced solutions that won't harm finishes,
and soft tools that protect your floors.

What DOES damage floors is improper cleaning - using too much water, harsh
chemicals like vinegar or ammonia, or abrasive tools. We avoid all of those.
Our process is specifically designed to clean and protect hardwood floors.

Q: How long does the service take?
A: It depends on square footage. A typical room (200 sq ft) takes about 45-60
minutes. An average whole-house service (1,000-1,500 sq ft) takes 2-3 hours.
Your floors will be ready to walk on in clean socks immediately after we finish,
and fully dry in 30-60 minutes.

Q: Do I need to move my furniture?
A: No - we clean around furniture. We don't move heavy pieces like sofas, beds,
or entertainment centers. We can clean under furniture if it's accessible
without moving (like under a sofa on legs). You should remove small items, area
rugs, and floor clutter before we arrive, but the furniture stays in place.

Q: How often should I have my hardwood floors professionally cleaned?
A: We recommend every 12-18 months for most homes. However, you might clean
more frequently if you have:
• High traffic areas or large families: Every 6-12 months
• Commercial spaces: Every 3-6 months
• Mostly low traffic: Every 18-24 months

Regular professional cleaning extends your floors' life, maintains their beauty,
and delays the need for expensive refinishing.

ABOUT RESULTS:

Q: Will cleaning make my dull floors shiny again?
A: In most cases, yes! Dull floors are usually caused by buildup from cleaning
products, body oils, cooking oils, and general soil. Our cleaning removes this
buildup, revealing the natural shine of your finish underneath.

However, if your floor finish is worn through or severely damaged, cleaning
will improve appearance but can't restore a worn finish. In those cases, we can
clean the floors and recommend finish renewal treatment, or suggest refinishing
if the finish is too worn.

Q: Can you remove scratches from my floors?
A: Cleaning removes dirt from scratches, which often makes them less noticeable.
However, we can't remove deep scratches that are actually in the wood or finish
- those would require buffing or refinishing. We can discuss spot repair options
for minor scratches, or recommend a refinishing professional for severe damage.

Q: Will my floors look brand new?
A: Your floors will look significantly better - brighter, cleaner, and shinier.
If the finish is in good condition, they can look close to new! However, we
want to set realistic expectations: cleaning reveals what's there. If floors
have wear patterns, deep scratches, or finish damage, cleaning will improve
appearance but can't reverse physical wear. For floors to truly look new, they'd
need complete refinishing.

ABOUT SAFETY AND HEALTH:

Q: Are your cleaning solutions safe for my family and pets?
A: Yes! Our wood floor cleaning solutions are pH-balanced and specifically
formulated to be safe for families and pets. We don't use harsh chemicals,
ammonia, or toxic substances. Your family and pets can return to the floors as
soon as they're dry - typically 30-60 minutes.

Q: Is there a strong odor during or after cleaning?
A: No. Our wood floor cleaning solutions have minimal odor - nothing like the
strong chemical smells of some cleaners or the intense fumes from floor
refinishing. You might notice a light, clean scent during the service, but it
dissipates quickly.

Q: Will cleaning help with allergies?
A: Yes, it can help! While hardwood floors don't trap allergens like carpet
does, they still accumulate dust, pollen, pet dander, and other allergens on
the surface. Our thorough cleaning removes these allergens, which can improve
indoor air quality and help allergy sufferers.

ABOUT PRICING AND VALUE:

Q: How much does wood floor cleaning cost?
A: We price by square footage, typically $0.50-1.00 per square foot depending
on floor condition and services selected. For example:
• Average room (250 sq ft): $125-250
• Whole house (1,500 sq ft): $750-1,500

The exact investment depends on your square footage, floor condition, and
whether you add finish renewal treatment. We provide free estimates and can
give you an exact price.

Q: Why should I pay for professional cleaning when I can mop for free?
A: I understand that question - and many people think the same way until they
understand the difference. Consider this:

DIY Mopping:
• Takes hours of your time on hands and knees
• Spreads dirty water and leaves residue
• May damage floors with too much water
• Results last days or weeks
• Gradually dulls finish with residue buildup

Professional Cleaning:
• We do all the work (typically 2-3 hours for whole house)
• Actually removes soil and buildup
• Protects floors with minimal moisture and proper products
• Results last 12-18 months
• Extends time between refinishing by years

When you consider that refinishing costs $3-5 per square foot ($4,500-7,500 for
a typical home) and professional cleaning delays that expense by years,
professional cleaning actually saves money while protecting your investment.
Plus, you get your time back!

Q: Do you offer any discounts or packages?
A: Yes! We offer:
• Whole-house discounts (10-15% off when cleaning all floors)
• Combination services (save when bundling with carpet or tile cleaning)
• Seasonal promotions throughout the year
• Loyalty discounts for returning customers
• Financing options for larger jobs

When you book, just ask about current specials!

ABOUT THE SERVICE:

Q: What do I need to do to prepare?
A: Preparation is minimal:
• Remove area rugs and mats
• Vacuum or sweep floors
• Clear floor clutter and small items
• Secure pets in another area
• Plan to stay off floors for 30-60 minutes during drying

We'll handle everything else!

Q: Can you clean floors with furniture in place?
A: Yes. We clean around furniture and can clean underneath furniture if it's
accessible without moving it. Heavy furniture stays in place. The only
requirement is that floor clutter and small items be cleared.

Q: What if I'm not satisfied?
A: We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied,
we'll return to address your concerns at no charge. If you're still not
satisfied, we'll refund your money. We stand behind our work.

================================================================================
8. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS
================================================================================

OBJECTION: "I can just mop them myself."

Response: "I completely understand - and most people do mop their own floors!
Here's what we've found though:

Daily or weekly mopping maintains surface cleanliness, but over time, three
things happen:
1. Product residue builds up, dulling your floors
2. Soil works into the finish, wearing it down faster
3. The finish becomes dull and lackluster no matter how much you mop

That's where professional cleaning comes in - it's not about replacing your
regular maintenance. Think of it like this: you brush your teeth daily, but you
still see a dentist twice a year for professional cleaning. Same concept.

Our professional service removes the buildup your mop can't, restores the shine,
and protects the finish. This extends the life of your floors and delays
expensive refinishing. Most customers mop weekly and have us professionally
clean every 12-18 months. Together, these keep your floors looking great for
years. Does that make sense?"

---

OBJECTION: "That's too expensive."

Response: "I appreciate your concern about the investment. Let me give you some
perspective on what you're protecting:

Hardwood floors cost $6-12 per square foot to install. For a typical 1,500 sq
ft home, that's a $9,000-18,000 investment. Refinishing those floors costs $3-5
per square foot - another $4,500-7,500.

Our cleaning service for that same home is typically $750-1,000, and it:
• Removes abrasive soil that wears down finish
• Restores beauty and shine
• Extends time between refinishing by 5-8 years
• Protects your $9,000-18,000 investment

When you look at it that way, professional cleaning is actually very affordable
insurance for your major investment. Plus, when you break it down to cost per
month over a year, it's only $60-80 per month - less than many people spend on
coffee!

And here's the thing: if you skip professional cleaning, you'll need refinishing
sooner. That's a $5,000-7,000 expense, plus 3-5 days of disruption, strong
odors, and moving all your furniture. Professional cleaning is much more
affordable and convenient. Does that help you see the value?"

---

OBJECTION: "My floors are too old/worn. It's not worth cleaning them."

Response: "I understand why you might feel that way. Here's what's interesting
though - floors that look old and worn are often just very dirty. You'd be
amazed at the transformation when we remove years of built-up soil and residue.

Now, I want to be honest: if your finish is worn through to bare wood, cleaning
will improve appearance but can't restore worn finish. However, our finish
renewal treatment can help extend the life before you need complete refinishing.

Here's my suggestion: Let us clean your floors. If you're not satisfied with
the improvement, we'll refund your money - our satisfaction guarantee. But I
bet you'll be pleasantly surprised. Most people think their floors need
refinishing when they really just need professional cleaning.

Plus, if you are planning to refinish eventually, professional cleaning now
maintains them and gives you time to budget for refinishing. And if you're
selling your home, clean floors show much better and can help with sale price -
for a fraction of refinishing cost.

What do you think - shall we give it a try and see what we can do?"

---

OBJECTION: "I'm planning to refinish them soon anyway."

Response: "That's great that you're planning ahead! Let me ask - when are you
planning to refinish?"

[If soon - within 1-3 months:]
"Since you're refinishing soon, you're right that professional cleaning probably
doesn't make sense. However, if there's any chance you'll delay refinishing,
cleaning now would maintain them in the meantime and extend how long you can
wait. But if you're committed to refinishing soon, I agree - save your money
for that!"

[If later - 6+ months:]
"That makes sense to plan ahead. Here's why cleaning might still make sense:

1. Clean floors now means you can enjoy beautiful floors for the next several
   months instead of living with worn, dirty floors while you save up or wait
   for the right time.
2. Professional cleaning might reveal your floors don't need refinishing as
   urgently as you thought - just professional cleaning plus finish renewal.
   That could save you thousands of dollars.
3. If you do still need refinishing, clean floors will help you live with them
   comfortably until you're ready.

For $[price], you get months of better-looking floors and valuable information
about whether you truly need refinishing. Plus, if you do refinish, you'll have
learned how to maintain them properly afterwards. Sound reasonable?"

[If unsure/indefinite:]
"Since you're not sure when you'll refinish, professional cleaning makes perfect
sense! It improves appearance now, protects the floors, and might delay
refinishing need by years - saving you thousands. Plus, you'll know exactly
what condition your floors are in, which helps you plan. Shall we get you
scheduled?"

---

OBJECTION: "I'm worried about water damage."

Response: "That's actually a very smart concern! Water damage is a real risk
with improper cleaning, which is exactly why our process is different.

Traditional mopping or steam cleaning uses excessive water that can:
• Seep between boards causing warping
• Penetrate wood causing cupping
• Damage the finish
• Create long drying times (hours or days)

Our Chem-Dry process is specifically designed to avoid this:
• We use minimal moisture - just enough to clean effectively
• Floors dry in 30-60 minutes, not hours
• No water pools or excessive wetness
• pH-balanced solutions designed for wood
• Technicians trained specifically in wood floor care

We've been cleaning hardwood floors this way for decades without damage issues.
In fact, our process protects your floors because we remove the abrasive soil
that causes wear while using safe moisture levels. Your concern about water is
exactly why you should choose professional service over DIY mopping - we know
how to clean safely. Does that address your concern?"

---

OBJECTION: "I need to think about it / talk to my spouse."

Response: "Absolutely, I completely understand - this is an investment in your
home and you should feel confident about the decision. While you're thinking it
over, is there any specific concern I can address? Is it about pricing, the
process, results expectations, or scheduling? I want to make sure you have all
the information you need to make the best decision.

[Listen to concerns and address them]

Also, I should mention that we're currently running [seasonal promotion /
referral incentive / first-time customer discount], but that offer ends [date].
If you decide to move forward, I'd hate for you to miss out on the savings. Can
I put you down for a tentative appointment while you discuss it? There's no
obligation, and you can always cancel or reschedule."

Alternative: "That makes perfect sense. Many couples like to discuss home
service decisions together. To help with your conversation, let me send you a
detailed written estimate along with some before-and-after photos and customer
testimonials. Is there anything specific your spouse would want to know about?
Also, we're offering [current promotion] through [date], so if you decide to go
ahead, I can lock in that pricing for you. Would [date/time] work for a
tentative booking while you decide?"

9. AI CHATBOT GUIDELINES
================================================================================

CRITICAL BRAND REQUIREMENTS:

**For complete brand standards and messaging requirements:**
→ See AI_KB_00_FOUNDATION_READ_FIRST.txt - Section 1: Core Brand Standards

**Key Reminders for Wood Floor Cleaning:**
- ALWAYS say "Chem-Dry" NOT "Chem-Dry's" (never possessive)
  - CORRECT: "The Chem-Dry wood floor cleaning" or "Chem-Dry wood floor cleaning"
  - INCORRECT: "Chem-Dry's wood floor cleaning"
- Water claims: Use "minimal moisture" rather than percentage for wood floors
- Residue claims: "no dirt-attracting residue" (not "no residue")
- Foundation principle: "Honesty is Everything"

For complete brand voice guidelines, prohibited language, and messaging standards, refer to the Foundation document.

AI CONVERSATION FLOW FOR WOOD FLOOR CLEANING:

Initial Inquiry Recognition:
• "I need my hardwood floors cleaned"
• "Wood floor cleaning"
• "Can you clean wood floors?"
• "Hardwood floor maintenance"

AI Response Template:
"I'd be happy to help with information about Chem-Dry's wood floor cleaning
service! To provide the most accurate information, may I ask:
• How much square footage of hardwood do you have?
• What areas have hardwood floors? (main floor, bedrooms, etc.)
• How long since they were last professionally cleaned or refinished?
• What concerns do you have about your floors? (dullness, buildup, wear)
• Do you know what type of finish your floors have? (polyurethane, wax, unsure)"

Qualification Questions (AI gathers info before transfer):
1. Square footage of hardwood floors?
2. Which areas have hardwood?
3. Last professional cleaning or refinishing date?
4. Current concerns (dullness, scratches, general maintenance)?
5. Finish type if known?
6. Planning to sell home or refinish?
7. Timeline for service?

Information Sharing Phase:
• Explain minimal moisture, wood-safe process
• Discuss typical pricing range based on their square footage
• Mention service duration (2-3 hours for typical home)
• Highlight finish renewal benefits
• Share guarantee and satisfaction policy
• Emphasize investment protection value

Pricing Guidance for AI:
When customers ask about pricing, provide ranges based on size:
• Small room (150 sq ft): "$75-115 for basic cleaning"
• Medium room (250 sq ft): "$125-190 for basic cleaning"
• Large room (400 sq ft): "$200-300 for basic cleaning"
• Whole house (1,500 sq ft): "$750-1,125 for basic cleaning"
• Add finish renewal: "+$0.25-0.50 per square foot recommended"

Always add: "Final pricing depends on exact square footage and floor condition.
We provide free estimates and can give you an exact price after assessment."

Handling Common Questions:

• "How different from mopping?" → "Mopping spreads dirt and leaves residue.
  Professional cleaning actually removes buildup, uses minimal moisture so
  floors dry in 30-60 minutes, and results last 12-18 months instead of days."

• "Will it damage floors?" → "Absolutely not! We use minimal moisture, pH-
  balanced solutions designed for wood, and verify your finish type first. Our
  process protects your floors."

• "How long to dry?" → "30-60 minutes. You can walk in clean socks immediately,
  fully dry in under an hour."

• "How often needed?" → "Every 12-18 months for most homes. High-traffic areas
  every 6-12 months."

• "Cleaning vs. refinishing?" → "Cleaning removes surface buildup and restores
  shine to existing finish. Refinishing sands down and applies new finish -
  only needed when finish is worn through. Most floors need cleaning, not
  refinishing."

Managing Expectations - CRITICAL:

Cleaning CAN:
• Remove soil and buildup from surface
• Restore shine to finish
• Make floors look significantly better
• Extend time between refinishing

Cleaning CANNOT:
• Fix worn-through finish
• Remove deep scratches in wood
• Repair warped or damaged boards
• Change wood color

Be honest when refinishing may be needed instead of cleaning.

Transfer to Human Representative:
AI should transfer when:
• Floors may need refinishing not cleaning
• Unknown or unusual finish type
• Large or complex jobs (2,000+ sq ft)
• Customer requests specific appointment scheduling
• Complex situations or emotional concerns
• Customer specifically asks to speak with a person

Transfer Script:
"I'd like to connect you with one of our wood floor specialists who can assess
your specific situation, provide a detailed quote, and schedule your service.
They'll be able to answer any specific questions about your floors and ensure
we provide the right service. One moment please..."

TONE AND STYLE:
• Protective and caring (emphasize protecting valuable investment)
• Educational (help customers understand finish vs. wood)
• Realistic but positive (set honest expectations)
• Professional confidence in wood floor expertise
• Avoid pushy sales tactics

WHAT AI SHOULD NOT DO:
• Guarantee that cleaning will make floors "like new"
• Diagnose whether refinishing is needed without assessment
• Provide exact pricing without square footage
• Make promises about scratch removal
• Contradict brand guidelines on possessive usage or residue claims

================================================================================
10. SALES BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

FOUNDATION OF WOOD FLOOR SALES:

Know the Investment:
• Hardwood installation: $6-12/sq ft
• Typical home investment: $9,000-18,000
• Refinishing cost: $3-5/sq ft ($5,000-7,000)
• Your service protects this major investment

Know the Process:
• Understand finish types and identification
• Know when refinishing is needed vs. cleaning
• Explain minimal moisture approach
• Convey expertise and confidence

Know the Value:
• Extends time between refinishing by years
• Protects $9,000-18,000 investment
• Maintains home value
• Provides continuous beauty vs. wear-then-refinish cycle

THE CONSULTATIVE APPROACH:

Ask About Their Floors:
• "How long have you had these floors?"
• "When were they last professionally cleaned or refinished?"
• "What concerns do you have about them?"
• "What prompted you to look into professional cleaning?"

Listen For:
• Emotional attachment ("We love these floors")
• Investment concern ("We paid a lot for these")
• Selling timeline ("Getting ready to list")
• DIY frustration ("I mop but they're still dull")

Respond Specifically:
Tailor your pitch to what they care about most.

FLOOR ASSESSMENT SKILLS:

Visual Inspection:
• Overall condition and shine
• Traffic patterns and wear
• Scratches, gouges, or damage
• Finish condition (good, worn, or gone)
• Soil level and buildup

Identify Finish Type:
• Polyurethane (most common): Hard coating, shiny or satin
• Wax: Soft finish, can scratch with fingernail
• Oil: Penetrating finish, less common
• Water drop test if unsure

Set Realistic Expectations:

Good Candidate (should clean):
• Dull from buildup
• Finish intact but dirty
• Regular maintenance needed
• "Your floors should respond beautifully to cleaning!"

Needs Assessment:
• Uncertain finish type
• Some wear visible
• "Let me test a small area to ensure we can safely improve these"

May Need Refinishing:
• Finish worn through in multiple areas
• Extensive deep scratches
• Significant damage
• "I want to be honest - these may need refinishing more than cleaning. Let me
  show you the worn areas..."

THE INVESTMENT PROTECTION FRAME:

For almost any objection, return to investment protection:

"I understand [their concern]. Here's what I want you to consider: You have a
$[9,000-18,000] investment in these floors. Professional cleaning for $[750-
1,000] protects that investment and delays $5,000-7,000 refinishing by years.
When you look at it that way, [address specific objection from this frame]."

THE COMPARISON CLOSE:

Compare options:
1. Do nothing = floors deteriorate, need refinishing sooner
2. DIY mopping = maintains surface but buildup continues
3. Professional cleaning = removes buildup, protects investment, extends floor
   life

POSITIONING FINISH RENEWAL:

This is your key upsell - position it strongly:

Always Recommend:
"I strongly recommend our finish renewal treatment. Here's why: after cleaning
removes all the buildup, the renewal treatment adds a protective layer that
enhances shine and protects against future wear. It's like putting a screen
protector on a phone - you wouldn't clean your phone screen and not protect it,
right? Same concept.

For your [square footage], finish renewal is $[X] additional. Most customers
find it absolutely worth it because it multiplies the benefits and protection
of the cleaning. Should we include that?"

Overcome Hesitation:
"I understand wanting to keep costs down. Here's how I think about it: you're
already investing $[cleaning cost] to remove buildup and restore beauty. For
just $[renewal cost] more, you significantly extend how long those results last
and add protection against future wear. It's the difference between good results
and excellent, long-lasting results. Most customers regret not adding it when
they see how good their floors look and wish the protection had been included."

SUCCESS METRICS:

Track:
• Average price per square foot
• Finish renewal uptake rate (goal: 60%+)
• Whole-house booking rate
• Bundle rate with other services
• Customer satisfaction scores
• Rebooking rate (12-18 months)

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT:

Learn About:
• Different wood species and characteristics
• Finish types and how to identify them
• When refinishing is needed vs. cleaning
• Common wood floor problems
• Proper maintenance between cleanings

Practice:
• Floor assessment and finish identification
• Setting realistic expectations
• Investment protection messaging
• Finish renewal positioning

11. QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF QUALIFICATION:
These questions help determine if the customer is a good fit for service, allow
accurate quoting, and uncover upselling opportunities.

MUST-ASK QUESTIONS:

1. SQUARE FOOTAGE:
   "How much square footage of hardwood flooring do you have?"

   Purpose: Essential for pricing, gauge scope of job

2. AREAS WITH HARDWOOD:
   "What areas have hardwood - just main floor, or bedrooms too?"

   Purpose: Determines comprehensive scope, identifies whole-house opportunity

3. LAST PROFESSIONAL CLEANING:
   "How long has it been since they were professionally cleaned?"

   Options: Never / Recently / Years ago

   Purpose:
   - Never = Likely heavy buildup, set appropriate expectations

   "Are you planning to sell your home?"

   Purpose:

Upsell Triggers:
• Floors have lost shine
• Customer wants results to last longer

Upsell Script - During Quoting:
"I strongly recommend our finish renewal treatment. After cleaning, we apply a
protective treatment that enhances your existing finish, adds a protective
layer, restores shine, and extends the time until you need refinishing. It adds
about $[X] to your service but provides months or years of additional protection
and beauty. Most customers choose finish renewal because it multiplies the
benefits of cleaning. Should we include that?"

Upsell Script - During Service:
"Your floors are looking great after cleaning! I'd like to recommend our finish
renewal treatment. This adds a protective layer that enhances shine and protects
against future wear. For $[X] additional, it's an excellent way to maximize
your investment. Most customers add this and are very glad they did. Would you
like me to include it?"

NATURAL SERVICE COMBINATIONS:

Wood Floors + Carpet Cleaning:
• Most homes have both flooring types
• Cleaning both in same visit = convenience
• Bundle discount: 10-15% off total
• Efficiency: Truck already on-site

Script: "I notice you also have carpets. Since we're already here cleaning your
hardwood floors, we can clean your carpets at the same time and save you 10-15%
on the bundled package. That way, all your flooring gets professionally cleaned
in one visit. Should I include both in your quote?"

Wood Floors + Tile and Grout Cleaning:
• Kitchens often have both wood and tile
• Bathrooms may have both
• Bundle discount: 10-15% off combined services
• Convenient: One visit, all hard surfaces

Script: "Since you have both hardwood and tile, it makes perfect sense to clean
both at once. We can do your wood floors and tile/grout in the same visit, save
you the bundling discount, and your entire hard surface flooring will be fresh
and clean. Should I include both?"

Wood Floors + Upholstery Cleaning:
• Living areas with wood floors often have upholstered furniture
• Complete room refresh
• Bundle discount opportunity

Script: "Your wood floors are going to look amazing. I also notice your

customers like having both done together. We offer bundle pricing when you
combine services. Interested?"

Value Proposition:
• Complete the look

Value Proposition:

at once, we can offer a whole-house discount of 10-15% off the total. Plus,

square footage] at $[discounted price]. Makes sense to do it all at once,
doesn't it?"

your next cleaning 12-18 months out at today's locked-in price, which protects
you from future rate increases. You get automatic reminders and priority
scheduling. Plus 10% off any additional services year-round. It's a 'set it and
